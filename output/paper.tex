\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction have leveraged the concept of tri-hybrid representation, which integrates geometric, photometric, and semantic information to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reconstructed models. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of the current methodologies, key innovations, and applications of tri-hybrid representation in 3D reconstruction. We aim to analyze the effectiveness of this approach in various domains such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and cultural heritage preservation. The review will also identify existing gaps in the literature and suggest potential areas for future research. By synthesizing recent studies, the paper will provide insights into the computational techniques and the integration challenges faced in tri-hybrid systems. Additionally, the review will discuss the impact of emerging technologies like deep learning and cloud computing on the evolution of tri-hybrid models in 3D reconstruction.
