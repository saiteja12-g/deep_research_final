\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction have leveraged the concept of tri-hybrid representation, integrating geometric, photometric, and semantic information to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reconstructed models. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of the current methodologies, key innovations, and applications of tri-hybrid representation in 3D reconstruction. We analyze various approaches that combine these three types of data to improve depth perception, object recognition, and scene understanding in complex environments. The review identifies critical gaps in current research, such as the need for more robust integration techniques and the challenge of processing high volumes of data efficiently. Opportunities for future research, including the application of machine learning algorithms and the development of more sophisticated fusion techniques, are discussed. This paper aims to provide a foundational understanding for researchers and practitioners alike, offering insights into the potential of tri-hybrid models to revolutionize 3D imaging technologies.
