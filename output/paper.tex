\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a comprehensive review of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on their application in criteria selection for various decision-making processes. As LLMs become increasingly capable of understanding and generating human-like text, their potential in automating and refining criteria selection has grown significantly. This review will cover the development of LLM architectures, with a particular emphasis on their integration into systems that require dynamic criteria selection, such as personalized content recommendation and strategic business planning. The paper will analyze the methodologies employed in recent studies, evaluate the effectiveness of these models, and discuss the ethical implications and challenges associated with their use. Additionally, it will identify gaps in the current research and suggest directions for future investigations to enhance the transparency, fairness, and efficiency of LLMs in criteria selection.

\section{Introduction}
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of artificial intelligence, particularly in the domain of natural language processing. These models, characterized by their vast size and complexity, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in generating human-like text and understanding nuanced language patterns. This paper focuses on a specific application of LLMs: their integration into decision-making processes through criteria selection. The significance of this study lies in the exploration of how LLMs can enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and fairness of decisions across various fields, including business, science, and public policy \cite{Zhou2010}.

\section{Literature Review}
The application of large language models (LLMs) in decision-making processes, particularly in criteria selection, has seen considerable advancements in recent years. This literature review explores the integration of LLMs into various decision-making frameworks, emphasizing their role in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of criteria selection.

\subsection{Evolution of Large Language Models in Decision-Making}
The inception of LLMs marked a transformative phase in computational linguistics, with models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) setting foundational principles \cite{Devlin2018}.

\section{Methodology}
This study employs a mixed-methods approach to examine the advancements in large language models (LLMs) for criteria selection in decision-making processes. Our methodology integrates both quantitative and qualitative analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of LLM architectures and their applications.

\section{Results}
The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in criteria selection was systematically evaluated using a variety of performance metrics and scenarios across different decision-making contexts. The age-based diffusion (AD) model, as discussed in \cite{2010.08157v1}, provided a foundational framework for understanding how LLMs can be tailored to enhance decision-making processes.

\section{Discussion}
The integration of large language models (LLMs) into dynamic decision-making environments, as evidenced by the methodologies and results discussed in previous sections, highlights a pivotal advancement in artificial intelligence applications. The age-based diffusion (AD) model, as discussed in \cite{2010.08157v1}, serves as a pertinent example where LLMs can significantly enhance the prediction accuracy of criteria selection processes in scientific publication popularity.

\section{Conclusion}
The exploration of large language models (LLMs) in the context of criteria selection for decision-making processes, as detailed in this paper, underscores a significant leap forward in the application of artificial intelligence technologies in complex, dynamic environments.
