Solution of generalized Volterra-type diﬀerintegral equations associated with this function as a kernel is derived by Kilbas et al. (2002). A general theory of generalized fractional calculus based on this function has been developed by Kilbas et al. (2004), generalizing the results for Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals and\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\nderivatives, which form the backbone of fractional diﬀerential equations.

This paper deals with the solution of uniﬁed fractional reaction- diﬀusion systems. The results are obtained in compact and elegant forms in terms of Mittag-Leﬄer functions and generalized Mittag-Leﬄer functions, which are suitable for numerical computation. On account of the most general char- acter of the derived results, numerous results on fractional reaction, fractional diﬀusion, and fractional reaction-diﬀusion problems scattered in the literature, including the recently derived results by the authors for reaction-diﬀusion mod- els, follow as special cases.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nReaction-diﬀusion models have found numerous applications in pattern forma- tion in biology, chemistry, and physics.. These systems show that diﬀusion can produce the spontaneous formation of spatio-temporal patterns. A piecewise linear approach in connection with the diﬀusive processes has been developed by Strier et al. (1995). A similar approach is recently used by Manne et al. (2000) to investigate eﬀects on the propagation of nonlinear wave fronts.\n\nThe simplest reaction-diﬀusion model can be described by an equation\n\n∂N ∂t = D ∂2N ∂x2 + λF(N), N = N(x,t) (1)\n\nwhere D is the diﬀusion constant and F(N) is a nonlinear function representing reaction kinetics. It is interesting to observe that for F(N) = γN(1 − N), (1)\n\n1\n\nreduces to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation and if, we set F(N) = γN(1−N2), it reduces to the real Ginsburg-Landau equation.\n\nA generalization of (1) has been considered by Manne et al. (2000) in the form\n\n∂2N ∂t2 + a ∂N ∂x = ν2∂2N ∂x2 + ξ2N(x,t), (2)\n\nwhere ξ indicates the strength of the nonlinearity of the system.\n\nIn this article, we present a straightforward method for the systematic deriva- tion of the solution of nonlinear reaction-diﬀusion equations connected with non- linear waves, which is a generalization of the eq. (2). The results are derived in a closed form by the application of Laplace and Fourier transforms, which are suitable for numerical computation. The present study is a continuation of our investigations reported earlier in the articles of Saxena et al. (2002, 2004, 2004a, 2004b, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c).",

In what follows, e (.) will be employed to denote the generalized Mittag-Leffler function, defined by (5).\n\n5 Solution of Fractional Reaction-Diﬀusion Equation\n\nIn this Section, it is proposed to derive the solution of the fractional diﬀusion system connected with nonlinear waves governed by the eq. (41). This system is a generalized form of the reaction-diﬀusion equation recently studied by Manne et al. (2000). The result is given in the form of the following\n\nTheorem 1. Consider the fractional reaction-diﬀusion equation associated with Caputo derivatives in the form\n\nt N(x,t) + a0 Dβ 0Dα t N(x,t) + b0Dγ t N(x,t) = ν2 −∞Dη xN(x,t) + ξ2N(x,t) + φ(x,t) (41) (0 ≤ α ≤ 1,0 ≤ β ≤ 1,0 ≤ γ ≤ 1,η > 0)\n\n10\n\n(39)\n\nwith initial conditions\n\nN(x,0) = f(x), x ∈ ℜ,limx→±∞N(x,t) = 0,t > 0, (42)\n\nwhere ν2 is a diﬀusion constant, ξ is a constant which describes the nonlinearity in the system, and ϕ(x,t) is nonlinear function which belongs to the area of reaction-diﬀusion, then there holds the following formula for the solution of (41):\n\n∞ ∞ 1 (−1)r N(x,t) = 2π −∞ Z r=0 e−ikx r l )albr−lt(α−γ)r+(γ−β)lf∗(k) (r\n\nXl=0\n\nX\n\n{Ed\n\nα,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+1(−ctα)\n\nn + atα−βEr+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+1(−ctα) + btα−γEr+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+1(−ctα) dk\n\n+ ∞ r t (−1)r l )albr−l ξ(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α−1dξ (r 2π 0 r=0 ∞ −∞ o e−ikxϕ∗(k,t − ξ)\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nXl=0\n\nX\n\nEr+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α(−bξα)dkdξ (43)\n\nwhere c = v2|k|δ − ξ2 and provided that the series and integrals in (43) are convergent.\n\nProof. Applying the Laplace transform with respect to the time variable t and using the boundary conditions, we ﬁnd that\n\nsαN∼(x,s) − sα−1f(x) + asβN∼(x,s) − asβ−1f(x) + bsγN∼(x,s) − bsγ−1f(x) = ν2 xN∼(x,s) + ξ2N∼(x,s) + ϕ∼(x,s) −∞Dη\n\nIf we apply the Fourier transform with respect to the space variable x, it yields\n\nsαN∼∗(k,s) − sα−1f∗(k) + asβN∼∗(k,s),−asβ−1f∗(k) + bsγN∼∗(k,s) − bsγ−1f∗(k) = −ν2|k|ηN˜∗(k,s) + ξ2N∼∗(k,s) + ϕ∼∗(k,s).\n\nSolving for N∼∗(k,s), it gives\n\nN∼∗(k,s) = (sα−1 + asβ−1 + bsγ−1)f∗(k) + ϕ∼∗(k,s) sα + asβ + bsγ + c (46)\n\nwhere c = ν2|k|η − ξ2.\n\nTo invert the eq. (46), it is convenient to ﬁrst invert the Laplace transform and then the Fourier transform. Inverting the Laplace transform with the help\n\n11\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\nof the results (29), (30), (31) and (32), it yields\n\n∞ r N∗(k,t) = (−1)r l )albr−lt(α−γ)r+(γ−β)lf∗(k) (r r=0 Xl=0 X Er+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+1(−ctα) h + atα−βEr+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α−β+1(−ctα)+ btα−γEr+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α−γ+1(−ctα) + ∞ (−1)r r l )albr−l (r i r=0 X t Xl=0 Z 0 ϕ∗(k,t − ξ)ξ(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α−1Er+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α(−cξα)dξ.\n\nFinally, the inverse Fourier transform of (47) gives the desired solution in the form\n\n∞ ∞ 1 (−1)r N(x,t) = 2π −∞ Z r=0 X Er+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)k+1(−ctα) e−ikx r Xl=0 l )albr−lt(α−γ)r+(γ−β)lf∗(k) (r h + abtα−βEr+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)k+11(−ctα)+ btα−γEr+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+1(−ctα) dk + ∞ r=0 X (−1)r 2π ∞ r Xl=0 l )albr−l (r Z 0 t i ξ(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α−1dξ × × −∞ e−ikxϕ∗(k,t − ξ)Er+1 α,(α−γ)r+(γ−β)l+α(−cξα)dk, (48)",

It is interesting to observe that the method employed for deriving the solution of the equations (41) and (42) as well as (71) and (72) in the space = LF = L(R+) × F(R) can also be applied in the space LF ′ = L′(R+) × F ′, where F ′ = F ′(r) is the space of Fourier transform of generalized functions .As an illustration, we can choose F ′ = S′ or F ′ = D′. The Fourier transforms in S′ and D′ are introduced by Schwartz and Gelfand and Shilov, respectively. S′ is the dual of the space S, which is the space of all inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions which, together with their derivatives approach zero more rapidly than any power of 1/|x| as |x| → ∞ (Gelfand and Shilov, 1964, p. 16). Here D′ is the dual of the space D which consists of all smooth functions with compact supports (Brychkov and Prudnikov, 1989, p. 3). For further details, the reader is referred to the monographs written by Gelfand and Shilov (1964) and Brychkov and Prudnikov et al. (1989), if we replace the Laplace and Fourier transforms in eqs. (10) and (12) by the corresponding Laplace and Fourier transform of the generalized functions.\n\nAcknowledgment The authors would like to thank the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi, for the ﬁnancial assistance for this work under project No. SR/S4/MS:287/05 which enabled this collaboration possible.",
