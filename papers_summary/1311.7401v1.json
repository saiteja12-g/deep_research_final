            "text": "5 Discussion\n\nThis paper introduces a framework for extracting 3D information from a textured 2D image building on the recently developed locally scaled point processes (Hahn et al., 2003). The per- spective scaling function quantiﬁes perspective foreshortening and the resulting inhomogeneity of the texture. The framework is quite ﬂexible regarding assumptions on the texture composi- tion in that it only requires the texture elements to be close to convex in shape and it successfully extracts useful information related to camera orientation.\n\nThe separation of image preprocessing and point detection on one hand and the estimation procedure for the scaling parameters on the other hand offers great ﬂexibility. We believe that the locally scaled point process framework can be applied in more general settings to analyse point patterns in images, for instance, as a new additional inference step in the texture detection algorithms discussed in Lafarge et al. (2010) and references therein. Due to the low computa- tional budget of our framework, it also seems feasible to combine it with image segmentation where 3D information is needed for several segments within an image, each of which might be covered with a different type of texture elements.\n\nThere are further considerable avenues for development. One area for future development is to build a large hierarchical framework where the three inference steps, the image preprocessing, the point detection and the parameter estimation, are joined in an iterative fashion. A fully Bayesian inference framework along the lines of the work of Rajala and Penttinen (2012) could also be an alternative to the composite likelihood estimation performed here. Future work will concentrate on embellishing our inference framework.\n\n6 Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Ute Hahn for sharing her expertise.

This paper introduces a statistical framework to learn shape from texture where convex texture elements in a 2D image are represented through a point process. In a ﬁrst step, the 2D image is preprocessed to generate a probability map corresponding to an estimate of the unnormalized intensity of the latent point process underlying the texture elements. The latent point process is subsequently inferred from the probability map in a non-parametric, model free manner. Finally, the 3D information is extracted from the point pattern by applying a locally scaled point process model where the local scaling function represents the deformation caused by the projection of a 3D surface onto a 2D image.\n\nKeywords: 3D scenes, convex texture elements, locally scaled point processes, near regular texture, perspective scaling, shape analysis\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nNatural images contain a variety of perceptual information enabling the viewer to infer the three-dimensional shapes of objects and surfaces (Tuceryan and Jain, 1998). Stevens (1980) observed that surface geometry mainly has three effects on the appearance of texture in images: foreshortening and scaling of texture elements, and a change in their density. Gibson (1950) proposed the slant, the angle between a normal to the surface and a normal to the image plane, as a measure for surface orientation. Stevens amended this by introducing the tilt, the angle between the surface normal’s projection onto the image plane and a ﬁxed coordinate axis in the image plane. In this paper, we will directly infer the surface normal from a single image taken under standard perspective projection.\n\nStatistical procedures for estimating surface orientation often make strong assumptions on the regularity of texture. Witkin (1981) assumes observed edge directions provide the necessary information, while Blostein and Ahuja (1989) consider circular texture elements with uniform intensity. Blake and Marions (1990) consider the bias of the orientation of line elements isotrop- ically oriented on a 3D plane, induced by the plane’s orientation under orthographic projection, along with a computational approach related to Kanatani’s texture moments (Kanatani, 1989).\n\n1\n\nMalik and Rosenholtz (1997) locally estimate “texture distortion” in terms of an afﬁne trans- formation of adjacent image patches. The strong homogeneity assumption underlying this ap- proach has been relaxed by Clerc and Mallat (2002), to a condition that is difﬁcult to verify in practice. Forsyth (2006) eliminates assumptions on the non-local structure of textures (like homogeneity) altogether and aims to estimate shape from the deformation of individual texture elements. Loh and Hartley (2005) criticize prior work due to the restrictive assumptions related to homogeneity, isotropy, stationarity or orthographic projection, and claim to devise a shape- from-texture approach in the most general form. Their work, however, also relies on estimating the deformation of single texture elements, similar to Forsyth (2006).\n\nWe propose a general framework for inferring shape from near regular textures, as deﬁned by Liu et al. (2009), by applying the locally scaled point process model of Hahn et al. (2003). This framework enables the simultaneous representation of local variability and global regu- larity in the spatial arrangement of texture elements which are thought of as a marked point process. We preprocess the image to obtain a probability map representing an unnormalized intensity estimate for the underlying point process, subsequently apply a non-parametric frame- work to infer the point locations and based on the resulting point pattern, learn the parameters of a locally scaled point process model to obtain a compact description of 3D image attributes.\n\nPoint process models have previously been applied in image analysis applications where the goal is the detection of texture elements, see e.g. Lafarge et al. (2010) and references therein. These approaches usually apply a marked point process framework, with marks describing the texture elements. Such set-ups rely on a good geometric description of individual texture el- ements, limiting the class of feasible textures. As our goal is not the detection of individual texture elements but the extraction of 3D information, we omit the modeling of each texture element and infer the latent point locations in a model free manner. Thus, our sole assumption regarding texture element shape is approximate convexity which offers considerable ﬂexibility.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section contains preliminaries on image geometry followed by the method section describing the image preprocessing, the point pattern detection and the point process inference framework. We then present results for both simulated and real images with near regular textures. Finally, the paper closes with a short discussion section.",

The world coordinates X = (X, X2, X3)' and image coordinates « = (a1, %2)' are aligned as shown in Fig. |I| Here, we denote the image domain by D and assume the image to be scaled to have fixed area, |D| = a.\n\nWe consider the basic pinhole camera (Hartley and Zisserman, 2000) and among the internal parameters, we only look at the focal length f > 0 which depends on the ﬁeld of view, see Fig. 1.

            "text": "3 Methods\n\nIn a ﬁrst step, we apply image preprocessing that generates a probability map Y = {Y (x) : x ∈ D, 0 ≤ Y (x) ≤ 1} representing the spatial arrangement of texture elements in the im- age. To this end, two elementary techniques are locally applied: Boundary detection and the corresponding distance transform. The former step entails either gradient magnitude computa- tion using small-scale derivative-of-Gaussian ﬁlters (Canny, 1986) or, for texture elements with less regular appearance, the earth-mover’s distance (Pele and Werman, 2009) between local his- tograms. Inspecting in turn the histogram of the resulting soft-indicator function for boundaries enables one to determine a threshold and apply the distance transform.\n\nIn our framework, the texture elements are regarded as a realization of a marked point process where the underlying point pattern is latent. The value of the probability map Y (x) in x ∈ D denotes the probability that one of the latent points is located in x. To recover the latent point pattern based on the information in Y , we ﬁrst search for local maxima in Y . That is, for some k1 > 0, let Wx = [x1 − k1,x1 + k1] × [x2 − k1,x2 + k1] and set\n\nΦ = {x ∈ D : Wx ⊂ D, Y (x) = max z∈Wx Y (z)}. (6)\n\nWe then deﬁne a neighbourhood relation on Φ by setting x1 ∼ x2 if\n\nmin z∈[x1,x2] Y (z) ≥ k2 max{Y (x1),Y (x2)}, (7)\n\nwhere x1,x2 ∈ Φ, [x1,x2] denotes the line from x1 to x2 and k2 is a constant with 0 < k2 < 1. We may now write Φ as a union of disjoint neighbourhood components, Φ = ∪i=1,...,n Ci, where each x ∈ Ci is neighbour with at least one point in Ci\\x. Under the assumption that the texture elements are close to convex, two points x1 and x2 in Φ are neighbours if and only if they likely fall within the same texture element. Hence, we estimate the latent point process Ψ as\n\nΨ = {x1,...,xn : Y (xi) = max z∈Ci Y (z)}. (8)\n\nFormally, a point process can be described as a random counting measure N(·), where N(A) is the number of events in A for a Borel set A of the relevant state space, in our context the image domain D. The intensity measure of the point process is given by Λ(A) = EN(A) and the associated intensity function is\n\nα(x) = lim |dx|→0 EN(dx) |dx| . (9)\n\nFor a homogeneous point process, it holds that α(x) = β for some β > 0, while for an inhomo- geneous point process where the inhomogeneity stems from local scaling (Hahn et al., 2003) we obtain\n\nα(x) = βc−2 η (x), (10)\n\nfor some scaling function c, : R’ —> R, with parameters 7. The scaling function c, acts as a local deformation in that it locally affects distances and areas. More precisely, v7(A) = J Gy(x)~*v\"(da), where v7 denotes the d-dimensional volume measure and v7 its scaled ver- sion for d = 1, 2.\n\nFor identiﬁability reasons, Prokešová et al. (2006) propose normalizing cη to conserve the total area of the state space. That is, they deﬁne the normalizing constant of the scaling function such that\n\nλ2(D) = c−2 η (x)λ2(dx).

Darker shades of gray indicate smaller distances.\n\nHahn er al.| (2003) and |ProkeSova ef al.| (2006) specifically consider the exponential scaling function with c, (x) o exp(7'x).

The upper limit wu restricting the range of the scaling parameter m ensures that (6, X) < 0 and therefore depends on the focal length f as well as on the size and location of the observation window D. As suggested by |ProkeSova et al.|(2006), we normalize the scaling function such that holds. That is, we solve\n\n|D| = a = γ(δ,h,f)dXP.

It sets the absolute scale and cannot be inferred from a single image. Furthermore, the scaling function is computationally tractable and, as for the exponential scaling discussed above, the scaled distance function is available in closed form,\n\nNie d.(a',a’) = d(a\", a7) x (6, h, f) x| vt (_2 ar) | (5.X'—XI) \\(5—xNE 6, XIE) (16)\n\nprovided that the basic requirement (6, X*) < 0 is fulfilled for all i = 1,...,n. Examples of scaled distances are given in Fig/4| When compared with Fig.|3| we see that the perspective scaling in results in similar distance scaling as the exponential scaling while it also provides a coherent description of the perspective foreshortening.\n\nFor a given image, we assume that the focal length f is known. It remains to estimate the parameters (β,η1,η2) of the intensity function in (15) based on the estimated point pattern Ψ. The desired 3D image information, the slant and the tilt of the surface, may then be character- ized by the scaling parameter estimates ˆη1 and ˆη2. The parameter estimation is performed by maximizing the composite likelihood, see e.g. Møller (2010), that takes the form\n\nL(W|8,m,m) x exp(—B|DI) 8\" [J e77(2'). (17) i=l",

The internal parameters correspond to the settings in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4.\n\nWe estimate the scaling parameters associated with the synthetic patterns via the compos- ite likelihood in (18). The true parameter values and the corresponding estimates are given in Table 1. While the estimation procedure is able to reconstruct the true values with a resonable accuracy, the results are slightly better for the regular patterns than for the random patterns. These results are representative for several further such examples (results not shown), and we conclude that the composite likelihood is able to identify the scaling parameters of the perspec- tive scaling function irrespective of the second order structure of the point pattern.\n\nTable 1: True angles and composite likelihood estimates for the surface normals of the simulated point patterns in Figures 2 and 5.

The original images are of size 1280 × 960 pixels and during the preprocessing they are downsided to 1066×846 pixels in order to eliminate boundary effects in the point detection. The probability maps and the resulting point patterns are shown in Fig. 7. We have here applied neighbourhoods of sixe 75 × 75 pixels for the tiling scenes and 55 × 55 pixels for the bricks scene, with a threshold of k2 = 0.25 for the neighbourhood relation in all cases. The point detection is very robust in the selection of threshold value and threshold values from 0.15 to 0.5 have limited effects on the results. It is somewhat more sensitive to changes in the neighbourhood size; for the tiling images neighbourhoods from 55×55 to 95×95 result in similar scaling parameter estimates while for the bricks image, slightly smaller neighbourhoods seem to be needed.\n\nFor deriving the information on camera positioning and angle from the point conﬁgurations in Fig. 7, we project the point process realizations onto an observation window D of dimension [−0.69,0.69]×[−0.50,0.50]. We further assume that the ﬁeld of view corresponds to a standard wide angle setting of φc = 54◦ and hence take f = 0.98 as a basis, the same settings as we applied in the simulation examples above.
