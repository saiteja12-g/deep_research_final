Experiments\n\nTo show how the superpixel number affects the performance of our model, we add an experiment to evaluate the root mean square (rms) errors and the training time of our pre-train model on the Make3D dataset by varying the superpixel number per image. Fig. 5 shows the results. As we can see, increasing the number of supperpixel per image yields further decrease in the rms error, but at the cost of more training time. We use ∼ 700 superpixels per image in all other experiments in this paper, therefore by increasing it, we can expect better results.\n\n11\n\n(A.16)\n\n15 8000 7000 g 2 z 5145 6000 e 8 — @ 5000 e g 14 @ 4000 § g = FA 2 3000 2 < E © 6 135 2000 3 F ir 1000 13 0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Number of superpixels per image Number of superpixels per image\n\nFigure 5: Left: Root mean square (C2 rms) errors vs. varying superpixel numbers on the Make3D dataset.

It is a challenging task as no reliable depth cues are available, e.g., stereo corre- spondences, motions etc. Previous efforts have been focus- ing on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, with all using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features from deep convo- lutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth esti- mations can be naturally formulated into a continuous con- ditional random ﬁeld (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural ﬁeld model for estimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. Speciﬁcally, we propose a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous CRF in a uniﬁed deep CNN framework.\n\nThe proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any extra in- formation injected. In our case, the integral of the partition function can be analytically calculated, thus we can exactly solve the log-likelihood optimization. Moreover, solving the MAP problem for predicting depths of a new image is highly efﬁcient as closed-form solutions exist. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of- the-art depth estimation methods on both indoor and out- door scene datasets.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEstimating depths from a single monocular image de- picting general scenes is a fundamental problem in com- puter vision, which has found wide applications in scene un- derstanding, 3D modelling, robotics, etc. It is a notoriously ill-posed problem, as one captured image may correspond\n\n∗This work is in part supported by ARC Grants FT120100969, LP120200485, LP130100156. Correspondence should be addressed to C. Shen (email: chhshen@gmail.com).\n\nto numerous real world scenes [1]. Whereas for humans, inferring the underlying 3D structure from a single image is of little difﬁculties, it remains a challenging task for com- puter vision algorithms as no reliable cues can be exploited, such as temporal information, stereo correspondences, etc. Previous works mainly focus on enforcing geometric as- sumptions, e.g., box models, to infer the spatial layout of a room [2,3] or outdoor scenes [4]. These models come with innate restrictions, which are limitations to model only particular scene structures and therefore not applicable for general scene depth estimations. Later on, non-parametric methods [5] are explored, which consists of candidate im- ages retrieval, scene alignment and then depth infer using optimizations with smoothness constraints. This is based on the assumption that scenes with semantic similar appear- ances should have similar depth distributions when densely aligned. However, this method is prone to propagate errors through the different decoupled stages and relies heavily on building a reasonable sized image database to perform the candidates retrieval. In recent years, efforts have been made towards incorporating additional sources of informa- tion, e.g., user annotations [6], semantic labellings [7,8]. In the recent work of [8], Ladicky et al. have shown that jointly performing depth estimation and semantic labelling can beneﬁt each other. However, they do need to hand- annotate the semantic labels of the images beforehand as such ground-truth information are generally not available. Nevertheless, all these methods use hand-crafted features.\n\nDifferent from the previous efforts, we propose to formu- late the depth estimation as a deep continuous CRF learning problem, without relying on any geometric priors nor any extra information. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [9] are popular graphical models used for structured predic- tion. While extensively studied in classiﬁcation (discrete) domains, CRF has been less explored for regression (con- tinuous) problems. One of the pioneer work on continuous CRF can be attributed to [10], in which it was proposed for global ranking in document retrieval. Under certain con- straints, they can directly solve the maximum likelihood optimization as the partition function can be analytically calculated. Since then, continuous CRF has been applied\n\n1\n\nfor solving various structured regression problems, e.g., re- mote sensing [11,12], image denoising [12]. Motivated by all these successes, we here propose to use it for depth esti- mation, given the continuous nature of the depth values, and learn the potential functions in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN).\n\nRecent years have witnessed the prosperity of the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN features have been setting new records for a wide variety of vision appli- cations [13]. Despite all the successes in classiﬁcation prob- lems, deep CNN has been less explored for structured learn- ing problems, i.e., joint training of a deep CNN and a graph- ical model, which is a relatively new and not well addressed problem. To our knowledge, no such model has been suc- cessfully used for depth estimations. We here bridge this gap by jointly exploring CNN and continuous CRF.\n\nTo sum up, we highlight the main contributions of this work as follows:\n\n• We propose a deep convolutional neural ﬁeld model for depth estimations by exploring CNN and continuous CRF. Given the continuous nature of the depth values, the partition function in the probability density func- tion can be analytically calculated, therefore we can directly solve the log-likelihood optimization without any approximations. The gradients can be exactly cal- culated in the back propagation training. Moreover, solving the MAP problem for predicting the depth of a new image is highly efﬁcient since closed form solu- tions exist.\n\n• We jointly learn the unary and pairwise potentials of the CRF in a uniﬁed deep CNN framework, which is trained using back propagation.\n\n• We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art results of depth estimation on both in- door and outdoor scene datasets.",

            "text": "2. Related work\n\nPrior works [7,14,15] typically formulate the depth es- timation as a Markov Random Field (MRF) learning prob- lem. As exact MRF learning and inference are intractable in general, most of these approaches employ approximation methods, e.g., multi-conditional learning (MCL), particle belief propagation (PBP). Predicting the depths of a new image is inefﬁcient, taking around 4-5s in [15] and even longer (30s) in [7]. To make things worse, these methods suffer from lacking of ﬂexibility in that [14,15] rely on hor- izontal alignment of images and [7] requires the semantic labellings of the training data available beforehand. More recently, Liu et al. [16] propose a discrete-continuous CRF model to take into consideration the relations between adja- cent superpixels, e.g., occlusions. They also need to use approximation methods for learning and MAP inference.\n\n2\n\nBesides, their method relies on image retrievals to obtain a reasonable initialization. By contrast, we here present a deep continuous CRF model in which we can directly solve the log-likelihood optimization without any approximations as the partition function can be analytically calculated. Pre- dicting the depth of a new image is highly efﬁcient since closed form solution exists. Moreover, our model do not inject any geometric priors nor any extra information.\n\nOn the other hand, previous methods [5,7,8,15,16] all use hand-crafted features in their work, e.g., texton, GIST, SIFT, PHOG, object bank, etc. In contrast, we learn deep CNN for constructing unary and pairwise potentials of CRF. By jointly exploring the capacity of CNN and continuous CRF, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor scene depth estimations. Perhaps the most related work is the recent work of [1], which is concurrent to our work here. They train two CNNs for depth map prediction from a single image. However, our method bears substantial differences from theirs. They use the CNN as a black-box by directly regressing the depth map from an input image through convolutions. In contrast, we use CRF to explicitly model the relations of neighbour- ing superpixels, and learn the potentials in a uniﬁed CNN framework. One potential drawback of the method in [1] is that it tends to learn depths with location preferences, which is prone to ﬁt into speciﬁc layouts. This partly explains why they have to collect a large number of labelled data to cover all possible layouts for training the networks (they collect extra training images using depth sensors) , which is in the millions as reported in [1]. Instead, our method en- joys translation invariance as we do not encode superpixel coordinates into the unary potentials, and can train on stan- dard dataset to get competetive performance without using additional training data. Furthermore, the predicted depth map of [1] is 1/4-resolution of the original input image with some border areas lost, while our method does not have this limitation.\n\nIn the most recent work of [17], Tompson et al. present a hybrid architecture for jointly training a deep CNN and an MRF for human pose estimation. They ﬁrst train a unary term and a spatial model separately, then jointly learn them as a ﬁne tuning step. During ﬁne tuning of the whole model, they simply remove the partition function in the likelihood to have a loose approximation. In contrast, our model performs continuous variables prediction. We can directly solve the log-likelihood optimization without using approx- imations as the partition function is integrable and can be analytically calculated. Moreover, during prediction, we have closed-form solution for the MAP inference.",

In the unary part, for a superpixel p, we crop the image patch centred around its centroid, then resize and feed it to a CNN which is composed of 5 convolutional and 4 fully-connected layers (details refer to Fig. 2). In the pairwise part, for a pair of neighbouring superpixels (p,q), we consider K types of similarities, and feed them into a fully-connected layer. The outputs of unary part and the pairwise part are then fed to the CRF structured loss layer, which minimizes the negative log-likelihood. Predicting the depths of a new image x is to maximize the conditional probability Pr(y|x), which has closed-form solutions (see Sec. 3.3 for details).\n\nerwise stated, we use boldfaced uppercase and lowercase letters to denote matrices and column vectors respectively.\n\n3.1. Overview\n\nThe goal here is to infer the depth of each pixel in a single image depicting general scenes. Following the work of [7[15[16], we make the common assumption that an im- age is composed of small homogeneous regions (superpix- els) and consider the graphical model composed of nodes defined on superpixels. Kindly note that our framework is flexible that can work on pixels or superpixels. Each su- perpixel is portrayed by the depth of its centroid. Let x be an image and y = [yi,---,Yn]' € R” be a vector of con- tinuous depth values corresponding to all n superpixels in x. Similar to conventional CRF, we model the conditional probability distribution of the data with the following den- sity function:\n\nHere, because y is continuous, the integral in Eq. can be analytically calculated under certain circumstances, which we will show in Sec. 3.3. This is different from the discrete case, in which approximation methods need to be applied. To predict the depths of a new image, we solve the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference problem: (A.1)\n\ny* = argmax Pr(y|x).

The unary part then takes all the image patches as input and feed each of them to a CNN and output an n-dimentional vector con- taining regressed depth values of the n superpixels. The network for the unary part is composed of 5 convolutional and 4 fully-connected layers with details in Fig. 2. Kindly note that the CNN parameters are shared across all the su- perpixels. The pairwise part takes similarity vectors (each with K components) of all neighbouring superpixel pairs as input and feed each of them to a fully-connected layer (parameters are shared among different pairs), then output a vector containing all the 1-dimentional similarities for each of the neighbouring superpixel pair. The CRF loss layer takes as input the outputs from the unary and the pairwise parts to minimize the negative log-likelihood. Compared to the direct regression method in [1], our model possesses two potential advantages: 1) We achieve translation invari- ance as we construct unary potentials irrespective of the su- perpixel’s coordinate (shown in Sec. 3.2); 2) We explic- itly model the relations of neighbouring superpixels through pairwise potentials.\n\nﬁve convolutional layers and the ﬁrst two fully connected layers. For the third fully-connected layer, we use the logis- tic function (f(x) = (1 + e−x)−1) as activiation function. The last fully-connected layer plays the role of model en- semble with no activiation function followed. The output is an 1-dimentional real-valued depth for a single superpixel.\n\nPairwise potential We construct the pairwise potential from K types of similarity observations, each of which en- forces smoothness by exploiting consistency information of neighbouring superpixels:\n\n1 Rpq(yp − yq)2, ∀p,q = 1,...,n. (6) V (yp,yq,x;β) = 2\n\nHere Rpq is the output of the network in the pairwise part (see Fig. 1) from a neighbouring superpixel pair (p,q). We use a fully-connected layer here:\n\nK Rpg = BSED...

(A4), we can see that we don’t use any activiation function. However, as our framework is general, more complicated networks can be seamlessly in- corporated for the pairwise part. In Sec we will show that we can derive a general form for calculating the gradi- ents with respect to B (see Eq. (A.14)). To guarantee Z (2) (Eq. {A.3}) is integrable, we require 5, > 0 {10}.\n\nIn the following, we describe the details of potential functions involved in the energy function in Eq. (4).",

Expanding Eq. {A.2), we have:\n\nE(y,x) =y' Ay —22'y+a'z. (10)\n\nDue to the quadratic terms of y in the energy function in Eq. (A.5) and the positive deﬁniteness of A, we can analytically calculate the integral in the partition function (Eq. (A.3)) as:\n\n2(x) = | exp(-Bly.9)}dy y = ~exp{z’ Avg —z'z}. (11) 2\n\nFrom Eq. (A.1), (A.5), (11), we can now write the probabil- ity distribution function as (see supplementary for details):\n\nAL Pr(y|x) = | 2 exp { —y! Ay +2z2'y — 2’ At2}, a (12)\n\nwhere z = [21,--.,2n]'; |A| denotes the determinant of the matrix A, and A~! the inverse of A. Then the negative log-likelihood can be written as:\n\n—log Pr(y|x) = y' Ay —2z'y +2’ AW!z (13) 1 7 -3 log(|A|) + 5 los(n).\n\nDuring learning, we minimizes the negative conditional log-likelihood of the training data.

We use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based back propagation to solve the optimization problem in Eq. (A.10) for learning all param- eters of the whole network. We project the solutions to the feasible set when the bounded constraints βk ≥ 0 is vio- lated. In the following, we calculate the partial derivatives of −logPr(y|x) with respect to the network parameters θl (one element of θ) and βk (one element of β) by using the\n\n5\n\nchain rule (refer to supplementary for details):",

Implementation details\n\nWe implement the network training based on the efﬁcient CNN toolbox: VLFeat MatConvNet1 [20]. Training is done on a standard desktop with an NVIDIA GTX 780 GPU with 6GB memory. During each SGD iteration, around ∼ 700 superpixel image patches need to be processed. The 6GB GPU may not be able to process all the image patches at one time. We therefore partition the superpixel image patches of one image into two parts and process them successively. Processing one image takes around 10s (including forward and backward) with ∼ 700 superpixels when training the whole network.\n\nDuring implementation, we initialize the ﬁrst 6 layers of the unary part in Fig. 2 using a CNN model trained on the ImageNet from [21]. First, we do not back propa- gate through the previous 6 layers by keeping them ﬁxed\n\n1VLFeat MatConvNet: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/\n\nError Accuracy Method (lower is better) (higher is better) rel log10 rms δ < 1.25 δ < 1.252 δ < 1.253 SVR 0.313 0.128 1.068 0.490 0.787 0.921 SVR (smooth) 0.290 0.116 0.993 0.514 0.821 0.943 Ours (unary only) 0.295 0.117 0.985 0.516 0.815 0.938 Ours (pre-train) 0.257 0.101 0.843 0.588 0.868 0.961 Ours (ﬁne-tune) 0.230 0.095 0.824 0.614 0.883 0.971\n\nTable 2: Baseline comparisons on the NYU v2 dataset.

The pre-train is rather efﬁcient, taking around 1 hour to train on the Make3D dataset, and infer- ring the depths of a new image takes less than 0.1s. Then we train the whole network with the same momentum and weight decay. We apply dropout with ratio 0.5 in the ﬁrst two fully-connected layers of Fig. 2. Training the whole network takes around 16.5 hours on the Make3D dataset, and around 33 hours on the NYU v2 dataset. Predicting the depth of a new image from scratch takes ∼ 1.1s.",

            "text": "4. Experiments\n\nWe evaluate on two popular datasets which are available online: the NYU v2 Kinect dataset [22] and the Make3D range image dataset [15]. Several measures commonly used in prior works are applied here for quantitative evaluations:\n\n|dgt\n\np −dp|\n\ndp dp), age? © average relative error (rel): + > D\n\np(dgt\n\n• root mean squared error (rms): p − dp)2;\n\nT\n\ne average logy, error (log10): a Up | logio dst — logo dp|;\n\n• accuracy with threshold thr:\n\npercentage (%) of dp s.t.:max( dgt p , dp ) = δ < thr;\n\ndgt\n\ndp\n\np\n\nwhere dgt p and dp are the ground-truth and predicted depths respectively at pixel indexed by p, and T is the total number of pixels in all the evaluated images.\n\n6\n\nWe use SLIC [23] to segment the images into a set of non-overlapping superpixels. For each superpixel, we con- sider the image within a rectangular box centred on the cen- troid of the superpixel, which contains a large portion of its background surroundings. More speciﬁcally, we use a box size of 168×168 pixels for the NYU v2 and 120×120 pixels for the Make3D dataset. Following [1,7,15], we transform the depths into log-scale before training. As for baseline comparisons, we consider the following settings:\n\n• SVR: We train a support vector regressor using the CNN representations from the ﬁrst 6 layers of Fig. 2;\n\n• SVR (smooth): We add a smoothness term to the trained SVR during prediction by solving the infer- ence problem in Eq. (18). As tuning multiple pairwise parameters is not straightforward, we only use color difference as the pairwise potential and choose the pa- rameter β by hand-tuning on a validation set;\n\n• Unary only: We replace the CRF loss layer in Fig. 1 with a least-square regression layer (by setting the pair- wise outputs Rpq = 0, p,q = 1,...,n), which degener- ates to a deep regression model trained by SGD.\n\n4.1. NYU v2: Indoor scene reconstruction\n\nThe NYU v2 dataset consists of 1449 RGBD images of indoor scenes, among which 795 are used for training and 654 for test (we use the standard training/test split provided with the dataset). Following [16], we resize the images to 427 × 561 pixels before training.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of our model, we ﬁrst compare with the three baseline methods and report the results in Ta- ble 2. From the table, several conclusions can be made: 1) When trained with only unary term, deeper network is beneﬁcial for better performance, which is demonstrated by the fact that our unary only model outperforms the SVR model; 2) Adding smoothness term to the SVR or our unary only model helps improve the prediction accuracy; 3) Our method achieves the best performance by jointly learning the unary and the pairwise parameters in a uniﬁed deep CNN framework. Moreover, ﬁne-tuning the whole network yields further performance gain. These well demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our model.\n\nIn Table 1, we compare our model with several pop- ular state-of-the-art methods. As can be observed, our method outperforms classic methods like Make3d [15], DepthTransfer [5] with large margins. Most notably, our results are signiﬁcantly better than that of [8], which jointly exploits depth estimation and semantic labelling. Compar- ing to the recent work of Eigen et al. [1], our method gener- ally performs on par. Our method obtains signiﬁcantly bet- ter result in terms of root mean square (rms) error. Kindly note that, to overcome overﬁt, they [1] have to collect mil- lions of additional labelled images to train their model. One",

In con- trast, we only use the standard training sets (795) without any extra data, yet we achieve comparable or even better performance. Fig. 3 illustrates some qualitative evalua- tions of our method compared against Eigen et al. [1] (We download the predictions of [1] from the authors’ website.). Compared to the predictions of [1], our method yields more visually pleasant predictions with sharper transitions, align- ing to local details.\n\n4.2. Make3D: Outdoor scene reconstruction\n\nThe Make3D dataset contains 534 images depicting out- door scenes. As pointed out in [15,16], this dataset is with limitations: the maximum value of depths is 81m with far- away objects are all mapped to the one distance of 81 me- ters. As a remedy, two criteria are used in [16] to report the\n\nprediction errors: (C1) Errors are calculated only in the re- gions with the ground-truth depth less than 70 meters; (C2) Errors are calculated over the entire image. We follow this protocol to report the evaluation results.\n\nLikewise, we ﬁrst present the baseline comparisons in Table 3, from which similar conclusions can be drawn as in the NYU v2 dataset. We then show the detailed results compared with several state-of-the-art methods in Table 4. As can be observed, our model with the whole network training ranks the ﬁrst in overall performance, outperform- ing the compared methods by large margins. Kindly note that the C2 errors of [16] are reported with an ad-hoc post- processing step, which trains a classiﬁer to label sky pixels and set the corresponding regions to the maximum depth. In contrast, we do not employ any of those heuristics to re- ﬁne our results, yet we achieve better results in terms of relative error. Some examples of qualitative evaluations are shown in Fig. 4. It is shown that our unary only model gives\n\n7\n\nMethod Error (C1) (lower is better) Error (C2) (lower is better) rel log10 rms rel log10 rms Make3d [15] - - - 0.370 0.187 - Semantic Labelling [7] - - - 0.379 0.148 - DepthTransfer [5] 0.355 0.127 9.20 0.361 0.148 15.10 Discrete-continuous CRF [16] 0.335 0.137 9.49 0.338 0.134 12.60 Ours (pre-train) 0.331 0.127 8.82 0.324 0.134 13.29 Ours (ﬁne-tune) 0.314 0.119 8.60 0.307 0.125 12.89\n\nTable 4: Result comparisons on the Make3D dataset.

Conclusion\n\nWe have presented a deep convolutional neural ﬁeld model for depth estimation from a single image. The pro- posed method combines the strength of deep CNN and con- tinuous CRF in a uniﬁed CNN framework. We show that the\n\nlog-likelihood optimization in our method can be directly solved using back propagation without any approximations required. Predicting the depths of a new image by solving the MAP inference can be efﬁciently performed as closed- form solutions exist. Given the general learning framework of our method, it can also be applied for other vision appli- cations, e.g., image denoising. Experimental results demon- strate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets.\n\n8\n\nA. Deep Convolutional Neural Fields\n\nIn this Appendix, we show some technical details about the proposed deep convolutional ﬁeld model.\n\nLet x be an image and y = [y1,..., Yn|' € R” be a vector of continuous depth values corresponding to all n superpixels\n\nin x. Similar to conventional CRF, we model the conditional probability distribution of the data with the following density function:\n\nPr(y|x) = 1 Z(x) exp{−E(y,x)}, (A.1)\n\nwhere E is the energy function and Z(x) the partition function, deﬁned respectively as:\n\nP 1 Ely, x) = Sw ~ zp) + > a Poa(Yp — Ya) (A.2) PEN (p.q)es\n\nZ(x) = exp{−E(y,x)}dy, (A.3) y\n\nin which,\n\nK Roq = > Bu Syas (A4) k=1\n\nwhere z is the regressed depths parametrized by θ (namely, z is the abbreviation of z(θ)), β = [β1,...,βK] the pairwise parameter, S(k) the k-th similarity matrix (which is symmetric) and K the number of pairwise terms considered. To guarantee Z(x) (Eq. (A.3)) is integrable, βk > 0 are required. We aim to jointly learn z(θ) and β here.\n\nBy expanding Eq. (A.2), we then have:\n\n1 1 2 2 2 2 Ely,x) = » yp -2 y Up2p + y ats » Ryg¥p — » Rpatnta + 5 » Rog = yly - daly talat y' Dy — y'Ry =y'(1+D-R)y-22'y4+a'z = TAy - Qaly +2! 2,\n\nwhere\n\nA = I + D − R. (A.6)\n\nHere, I is the nxn identity matrix; D is a diagonal matrix with D,, = Yq\n\nq Rpq. Since βk ≥ 0 are enforced, A is ensured to be positive deﬁnite (A is symmetric, and strictly diagonally dominant with positive diagonal entries). We can then calculate the partition function according to the Gaussian integral formula as:\n\nZ(x) = [of ~ Ely,x) }dy = [oof ~y!

From Eq. (A.1), (A.5), (A.7), we can write the probability density function as:\n\nexp − E(y,x) Pr(y|x) = Z(x) (A.8)\n\n=\n\n{. @ lait",

Here’s a breakdown of the components:\n\n- **Input**: The input image size is 224x224 pixels.\n- **Layers**:\n  - **Convolutional Layers**: \n    - The first layer applies an 11x11 convolution followed by a ReLU activation function and 2x2 pooling, outputting 64 feature maps.\n    - This is followed by a 5x5 convolution, ReLU activation, and 2x2 pooling, producing 256 feature maps.\n    - Two subsequent 3x3 convolutional layers each followed by ReLU, maintaining 256 feature maps.\n    - Another 3x3 convolution with ReLU and 2x2 pooling, maintaining 256 feature maps.\n- **Fully Connected (fc) Layers**:\n  - The architecture then transitions to fully connected layers with outputs of size 4096, 128, and 16, each followed by a ReLU activation.\n  - The final layer uses a logistic activation, suggesting a classification or binary output.\n  \nThis diagram is important for understanding the architecture used in the research, showing how the input image is processed through various convolutional and fully connected layers to produce the final output. It likely represents a core component of the methodology in the study.",

It shows a decreasing trend, indicating that as the number of superpixels increases, the RMS error declines, suggesting improved accuracy or performance.\n  \n- The right graph shows the correlation between the number of superpixels and training time in seconds. It exhibits an increasing trend, demonstrating that higher numbers of superpixels lead to longer training times.\n\nTogether, these graphs highlight a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, which is essential for understanding the efficiency and effectiveness of the method or system being studied in the research.",
