We explore the performance of our model by training on several datasets. We show in ﬁgure 4 that it can capture rich statistics of shapes, translations and rotations across the datasets. For simpler datasets such as Primitives and MNIST3D (ﬁgure 4 left, middle), the model learns to produce very sharp samples. Even for the more complex ShapeNet dataset (ﬁgure 4 right) its samples show a large diversity of shapes whilst maintaining ﬁne details.\n\n3.2 Probabilistic volume completion and denoising\n\nWe test the ability of the model to impute missing data in 3D volumes. This is a capability that is often needed to remedy sensor defects that result in missing or corrupt regions, (see for instance [37, 6]). For volume completion, we use an unconditional volumetric model and alternate between inference and generation, feeding the result of one into the other. This procedure simulates a Markov chain and samples from the correct distribution, as we show in appendix A.10.

Figure 5 demonstrates that our model successfully completes large missing regions with high precision. More examples are shown in the appendix A.7.\n\n3.3 Conditional volume generation\n\nThe models can also be trained with context representing the class of the object, allowing for class conditional generation. We train a class-conditional model on ShapeNet and show multiple samples for 10 of the 40 classes in ﬁgure 7. The model produces high-quality samples of all classes. We note their sharpness, and that they accurately capture object rotations, and also provide a variety of plausible generations. Samples for all 40 ShapeNet classes are shown in appendix A.8.\n\nWe also form conditional models using a single view of 2D contexts. Our results, shown in ﬁgure 8 indicate that the model generates plausible shapes that match the constraints provided by the context and captures the multi-modality of the posterior. For instance, consider ﬁgure 8 (right). The model is conditioned on a single view of an object that has a triangular shape. The model’s three shown samples have greatly varying shape (e.g., one is a cone and the other a pyramid), whilst maintaining the same triangular projection. More examples of these inferences are shown in the appendix A.9.",

            "text": "3.4 Performance benchmarking\n\nWe quantify the performance of the model by computing likelihood scores, varying the number of conditioning views and the number of inference steps in the model. Figure 6 indicates that the number of generation steps is a very important factor for performance (note that increasing the number of steps does not affect the total number of parameters in the model). Additional context views generally improves the model’s performance but the effect is relatively small. With these experiments we establish the ﬁrst benchmark of likelihood-bounds on Primitives (unconditional: 500 nats; 3-views: 472 nats), MNIST3D (unconditional: 410 nats; 3-views: 393 nats) and ShapeNet (unconditional: 827 nats; 3-views: 814 nats). As a strong baseline, we have also trained a deterministic 6-layer volumetric convolutional network with Bernoulli likelihoods to generate volumes conditioned on 3 views. The performance of this model is indicated by the red line in ﬁgure 6. Our generative model substantially outperforms the baseline for all 3 datasets, even when conditioned on a single view.\n\n3.5 Multi-view training\n\nIn most practical applications, ground-truth volumes are not available for training. Instead, data is captured as a collection of images (e.g., from a multi-camera rig or a moving robot). To accommodate this fact, we extend the generative model with a projection operator that maps the internal volumetric representation hT to a 2D image ˆx. This map imitates a ‘camera’ in that it ﬁrst applies an afﬁne transformation to the volumetric representation, and then ﬂattens the result using a convolutional network. The parameters of this projection operator are trained jointly with the rest of the model. Further details are explained in the appendix A.4.\n\nIn this experiment we train the model to learn to reproduce an image of the object given one or more views of it from ﬁxed camera locations. It is the model’s responsibility to infer the volumetric representation as well as the camera’s position relative to the volume. It is clear to see how the model can ‘cheat’ by generating volumes that lead to good reconstructions but do not capture the underlying 3D structure. We overcome this by reconstructing multiple views from the same volumetric\n\n6",

Volumes are ﬂexible and can capture a diverse range of structures, however they introduce modeling and computational challenges due to their high dimensionality. Conversely, meshes can be much lower dimensional and therefore easier to work with, and they are the data-type of choice for common rendering engines, however standard paramaterizations can be restrictive in the range of shapes they can capture. It will be of interest to consider other representation types, such as NURBS, or training with a volume-to-mesh conversion algorithm (e.g., marching cubes) in the loop.\n\nREGED ANB OE\n\nFigure 8: Recovering 3D structure from 2D images: The model is trained on volumes, conditioned on c as context.

In this paper we learn strong deep generative models of 3D structures, and recover these structures from 2D images via probabilistic inference.

This demonstrates for the ﬁrst time the feasibility of learning to infer 3D representations of the world in a purely unsupervised manner.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nWe live in a three-dimensional world, yet our observations of it are typically in the form of two- dimensional projections that we capture with our eyes or with cameras. A key goal of computer vision is that of recovering the underlying 3D structure that gives rise to these 2D observations.\n\nThe 2D projection of a scene is a complex function of the attributes and positions of the camera, lights and objects that make up the scene. If endowed with 3D understanding, agents can abstract away from this complexity to form stable, disentangled representations, e.g., recognizing that a chair is a chair whether seen from above or from the side, under different lighting conditions, or under partial occlusion. Moreover, such representations would allow agents to determine downstream properties of these elements more easily and with less training, e.g., enabling intuitive physical reasoning about the stability of the chair, planning a path to approach it, or ﬁguring out how best to pick it up or sit on it. Models of 3D representations also have applications in scene completion, denoising, compression and generative virtual reality.\n\nThere have been many attempts at performing this kind of reasoning, dating back to the earliest years of the ﬁeld. Despite this, progress has been slow for several reasons: First, the task is inherently ill- posed. Objects always appear under self-occlusion, and there are an inﬁnite number of 3D structures that could give rise to a particular 2D observation. The natural way to address this problem is by learning statistical models that recognize which 3D structures are likely and which are not. Second, even when endowed with such a statistical model, inference is intractable. This includes the sub-tasks of mapping image pixels to 3D representations, detecting and establishing correspondences between\n\n29th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\n\ndifferent images of the same structures, and that of handling the multi-modality of the representations in this 3D space. Third, it is unclear how 3D structures are best represented, e.g., via dense volumes of voxels, via a collection of vertices, edges and faces that deﬁne a polyhedral mesh, or some other kind of representation. Finally, ground-truth 3D data is difﬁcult and expensive to collect and therefore datasets have so far been relatively limited in size and scope.\n\nIn this paper we introduce a family of generative models of 3D structures and recover these structures from 2D images via probabilistic inference. Learning models of 3D structures di- rectly from pixels has been a long-standing research problem and a number of approaches with different levels of underlying assumptions and feature engineering have been proposed. Tra- ditional approaches to vision as inverse graphics [25, 22, 24] and analysis-by-synthesis [28, 35, 20, 36] rely on heavily engi- neered visual features with which inference of object properties such as shape and pose is substantially simpliﬁed. More recent work [20, 6, 4, 38] addresses some of these limitations by learn- ing parts of the encoding-decoding pipeline depicted in ﬁgure 2 in separate stages. Concurrent to our work [13] also develops a generative model of volumetric data based on adversarial\n\nQ\n\nQ",

Learning the 3D transformation properties of images by imposing a group-theoretical structure in the latent-space is a promising new direction [5]. Our approach differs, in that we add more structure to the model’s rendering component, while keeping an abstract latent code. We discuss other related work in A.1. Unlike existing approaches, our approach is one of the ﬁrst to learn 3D representations of complex objects in an unsupervised, end-to-end manner, directly from 2D images.\n\nOur contributions are as follows. (a) We design a strong generative model of 3D structures, deﬁned over the space of volumes and meshes, combining ideas from state-of-the-art generative models of images [10]. (b) We show that our models produce high-quality samples, can effectively capture uncertainty and are amenable to probabilistic inference, allowing for applications in 3D generation and simulation. We report log-likelihoods on a dataset of shape primitives, a 3D version of MNIST, and on ShapeNet [2], which to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the ﬁrst quantitative benchmark for 3D density modeling. (c) We show how complex inference tasks, e.g., that of inferring plausible 3D structures given a 2D image, can be achieved using conditional training of the models. We demonstrate that such models recover 3D representations in one forward pass of a neural network and they accurately capture the multi-modality of the posterior. (d) We explore both volumetric and mesh-based representations of 3D structure. The latter is achieved by ﬂexible inclusion of off-the-shelf renders such as OpenGL [30]. This allows us to build in further knowledge of the rendering process, e.g., how light bounces of surfaces and interacts with its material’s attributes. (e) We show how the aforementioned models and inference networks can be trained end-to-end directly from 2D images without any use of ground-truth 3D labels.

            "text": "2 Conditional Generative Models\n\nIn this section we develop our framework for learning models of 3D structure from volumetric data or directly from images. We consider conditional latent variable models, structured as in ﬁgure 2 (left). Given an observed volume or image x and a context c, we wish to infer a corresponding 3D representation h (which can be a volume or a mesh). This is achieved by modelling the latent manifold of object shapes and poses via the low-dimensional codes z. The context is any quantity that is always observed at both train- and test-time, and it conditions all computations of inference and generation (see ﬁgure 2, middle). In our experiments, context is either 1) nothing, 2) an object class label, or 3) one or more views of the scene from different cameras.\n\nOur models employ a generative process which consists of ﬁrst generating a 3D representation h (ﬁgure 2, middle) and then projecting to the domain of the observed data (ﬁgure 2, right). For instance, the model will ﬁrst generate a volume or mesh representation of a scene or object and then render it down using a convolutional network or an OpenGL renderer to form a 2D image.\n\nGenerative models with latent variables describe probability densities p(x) over datapoints x im- plicitly through a marginalization of the set of latent variables z, p(x) = { po(x|z)p(z)dz.

This is achieved by modeling the latent manifold of object shapes via the low-dimensional codes z. In experiments we will consider unconditional models (i.e., no context), as well as models where the context c is class or one or more 2D views of the scene. Right: We train a context- conditional inference network (red) and object model (green). When ground-truth volumes are available, they can be trained directly. When only ground-truth images are available, a renderer is required to measure the distance between an inferred 3D representation and the ground-truth image.\n\nmodels can be built by using multiple layers of latent variables, where each layer specifies a con- ditional distribution parameterized by a deep neural network. Examples of such models include [18] 29]. The marginal likelihood p(x) is intractable and we must resort to approximations. We opt for variational approximations [16], in which we bound the marginal likelihood p(x) by F = Eq(z\\x) [log po(x|z)| — KL[q¢(z|x)||p(z)], where the true posterior distribution is approximated by a parametric family of posteriors qg(z|x) with parameters ¢. Learning involves joint optimization of the variational parameters ¢ and model parameters 0. In this framework, we can think of the generative model as a decoder of the latent variables, and the inference network as an encoder of the observed data into the latent representation. Gradients of F are estimated using path-wise derivative estimators (‘reparameterization trick’)",

This family of models generates the observed data over the course of T computational steps. More precisely, these models operate by sequentially transforming independently generated Gaussian latent variables into reﬁnements of a hidden representation h, which we refer to as the ‘canvas’. The ﬁnal conﬁguration of the canvas, hT, is then transformed into the target data x (e.g. an image) through a ﬁnal smooth transformation. In our framework, we refer to the hidden representation hT as the ‘3D representation’ since it will have a special form that is amenable to 3D transformations. This generative process is described by the following equations:\n\nLatents zt∼ N(·|0,1)\n\n(1) 3D representation ht= fwrite(st,ht−1;θw) (4)\n\nEncoding et= fread(c,st−1;θr)\n\n2D projection ˆx = Proj(hT,sT;θp)\n\n(2)\n\n(5)\n\nHidden state st= fstate(st−1,zt,et;θs) (3)\n\nObservation x ∼ p(x|ˆx).\n\n(6)\n\nEach step generates an independent set of K-dimensional variables zt (equation 1). We use a fully con- nected long short-term memory network (LSTM, [11]) as the transition function fstate(st−1,zt,c;θs). The context encoder fread(c,st−1;θr) is task dependent; we provide further details in section 3.\n\nWhen using a volumetric latent 3D representation, the representation update function fwrite(st,ht−1;θw) in equation 4 is parameterized by a volumetric spatial transformer (VST, [12]). More precisely, we set fwrite(st,ht−1;θw) = VST(g1(st),g2(st)) where g1 and g2 are MLPs that take the state st and map it to appropriate sizes. More details about the VST are provided in the appendix A.3. When using a mesh 3D representation fwrite is a fully-connected MLP.\n\nThe function Proj(hT,sT) is a projection operator from the model’s latent 3D representation hT to the training data’s domain (which in our experiments is either a volume or an image) and plays the role of a ‘renderer’.

We denote the set of all parameters of this generative model as θ = {θr,θw,θs,θp}. Details of the inference model and the variational bound is provided in the appendix A.2.\n\nHere we discuss the projection operators in detail. These drop-in modules relate a latent 3D represen- tation with the training data. The choice of representation (volume or mesh) and the type of available training data (3D or 2D) determine which operator is used.\n\n3D → 3D projection (identity): In cases where training data is already in the form of volumes (e.g., in medical imagery, volumetrically rendered objects, or videos), we can directly deﬁne the likelihood density p(x|ˆx), and the projection operator is simply the identity ˆx = hT function (see ﬁgure 3 left).\n\n3D → 2D neural projection (learned): In most practical applications we only have access to images captured by a camera. Moreover, the camera pose may be unknown or partially known. For these cases, we construct and learn a map from an F-dimensional volume hT to the observed 2D images by combining the VST with 3D and 2D convolutions. When multiple views from different positions are simultaneously observed, the projection operator is simply cloned as many times as there are target views. The parameters of the projection operator are trained jointly with the rest of the model. This operator is depicted in ﬁgure 3 (middle). For details see appendix A.4.\n\n3D → 2D OpenGL projection (ﬁxed): When working with a mesh representation, the projection operator in equation 4 is a complex map from the mesh description h provided by the generative model to the rendered images ˆx. In our experiments we use an off-the-shelf OpenGL renderer and treat it as a black-box with no parameters. This operator is depicted in ﬁgure 3 (right).\n\nA challenge in working with black-box renderers is that of back-propagating errors from the image to the mesh. This requires either a differentiable renderer [24], or resort to gradient estimation techniques such as ﬁnite-differences [7] or Monte Carlo estimators [26, 1]. We opt for a scheme based on REINFORCE [34], details of which are provided in appendix A.5.",

We experiment with a 40-class subset of the dataset, commonly referred to as ShapeNet40. We render each mesh as a binary 30 × 30 × 30 volume.\n\nFor all experiments we used LSTMs with 300 hidden neurons and 10 latent variables per generation step. The context encoder fc(c,st−1) was varied for each task. For image inputs we used convolutions and standard spatial transformers, and for volumes we used volumetric convolutions and VSTs. For the class-conditional experiments, the context c is a one-hot encoding of the class. As meshes are much lower-dimensional than volumes, we set the number of steps to be T = 1 when working with this representation. We used the Adam optimizer [19] for all experiments.",

This enforces a consistent hidden representation that generalises to new views.\n\nWe train a model that conditions on 3 ﬁxed context views to reproduce 10 simultaneous random views of an object. After training, we can sample a 3D representation given the context, and render it from arbitrary camera angles. We show the model’s ability to perform this kind of inference in ﬁgure 9. The resulting network is capable of producing an abstract 3D representation from 2D observations that is amenable to, for instance, arbitrary camera rotations.\n\n3.6 Single-view training\n\nFinally, we consider a mesh-based 3D representation and demonstrate the feasibility of training our models with a fully-ﬂedged, black-box renderer in the loop. Such renderers (e.g. OpenGL) accurately capture the relationship between a 3D representation and its 2D rendering out of the box. This image is a complex function of the objects’ colors, materials and textures, positions of lights, and that of other objects. By building this knowledge into the model we give hints for learning and constrain its hidden representation.\n\nWe consider again the Primitives dataset, however now we only have access to 2D images of the objects at training time. The primitives are textured with a color on each side (which increases the complexity of the data, but also makes it easier to detect the object’s orientation relative to the camera), and are rendered under three lights. We train an unconditional model that given a 2D image, infers the parameters of a 3D mesh and its orientation relative to the camera, such that when textured and rendered reconstructs the image accurately. The inferred mesh is formed by a collection of 162 vertices that can move on ﬁxed lines that spread from the object’s center, and is parameterized by the vertices’ positions on these lines.\n\nThe results of these experiments are shown in ﬁgure 10. We observe that in addition to reconstructing the images accurately (which implies correct inference of mesh and camera), the model correctly infers the extents of the object not in view, as demonstrated by views of the inferred mesh from unobserved camera angles.",

The model we present in this paper extends ideas from the current state-of-the art in deep generative modelling of images [10, 9, 14] to volumetric data. Since these models operate on smooth internal representations, they can be combined with continuous projection operators more easily than prior work.\n\nOn the other hand, mesh representations allow for a more compact, yet still rich, representation space. When combined with OpenGL, we can exploit these representations to more accurately capture the physics of the rendering process. Related work include deformable-parts models [3, 8, 17] and approaches from inverse graphics [36, 21, 7, 24].\n\nA.2 Inference model\n\nWe use a structured posterior approximation that has an auto-regressive form, i.e. q(zt|z<t,x,c). This distribution is parameterized by a deep network:\n\nRead Operation rt = fr(x,st−1;φr) Sample zt ∼ N(zt|µ(rt,st−1,c;φµ),σ(rt,st−1,c;φσ)) (7) (8)\n\nThe ‘read’ function fr is parametrized in the same way as fw(st,ht−1;θh). During inference, the states st are computed using the same state transition function as in the generative model. We denote the parameters of the inference model by φ = {φr,φµ,φσ}.\n\nThe variational loss function associated with this model is given by:\n\nF = -Eg(zy,,..,rix,e) [log po(x|a1,....7,€)] + Dy KL [qe (zelz<ex)||p(ee)], (9)\n\nwhere z<t indicates the collection of all latent variables from iteration 1 to t − 1. We can now optimize this objective function for the variational parameters φ and the model parameters θ by stochastic gradient descent.",

For each image we sample K realizations of the inferred mesh for a ﬁxed set of latent variables using a small Gaussian noise and compute its corresponding render. The variance of the learning signal for each sample k is reduced by computing a ‘baseline’ using the K − 1 remaining samples. See [26] for further details. The estimator is easy to implement and we found this approach to work well in practice even for relatively high-dimensional meshes.\n\n13",

We review below the derivations from for completeness. Let x, and x, be the observed and unobserved parts of x respectively. The observed x, is fixed throughout, therefore all the computations in this section will be conditioned on x,. The imputation procedure can be written formally as a Markov chain on the space of missing entries x. with transition kernel K1(xi,|Xu, Xo) given by\n\nIE\" (x,laenxo) = | [voc x6lz)alairsdxeda, (ao)\n\nwhere x = (xu,xo).\n\nProvided that the recognition model q(z|x) constitutes a good approximation of the true posterior p(z|x), (10) can be seen as an approximation of the kernel\n\nK(x a0) = ff plo, xole)plala dare ay\n\nThe kernel {11} has two important properties: (i) it has as its eigen-distribution the marginal p(x.,.|x.); (ii) K(x1,|Xu, Xo) > 0 VXo, Xu, Xu. The property (i) can be derived by applying the kernel {I1) to the marginal p(Xu|Xo) and noting that it is a fixed point. Property (ii) is an immediate consequence of the smoothness of the model.\n\nWe apply the fundamental theorem for Markov chains and conclude that given the above properties, a Markov chain generated by (11) is guaranteed to generate samples from the correct marginal p(xu|xo).\n\nIn practice, the stationary distribution of the completed data will not be exactly the marginal p(xu|xo), since we use the approximated kernel (10). Even in this setting we can provide a bound on the L1 norm of the difference between the resulting stationary marginal and the target marginal p(xu|xo)\n\nProposition A.1 (L1 bound on marginal error ). If the recognition model q(z|x) is such that for all z\n\n/ — dx<e (12) de > Os.t. — p(x|z)\n\nthen the marginal p(xu|xo) is a weak ﬁxed point of the kernel (10) in the following sense:\n\n/ [ (4 ilu.) — K(x),|Xu,Xo)) D(Ku|Xo)dxu}dxi, < e.

Each pipeline features the following components:\n\n- **VST (Volumetric Spatial Transformer):** This component is used to transform the input volumes, possibly aligning them or extracting specific features based on the camera parameter \\( s_T \\).\n\n- **3D Convolution (3D conv):** This layer processes the volumetric data, extracting features in three dimensions and reducing the dimensionality from 3D to 2D.\n\n- **2D Convolution (2D conv):** This layer further processes the transformed features, refining them into the final 2D image representation.\n\n- **Resultant Images:** Each pipeline results in an image output with progressively reduced dimensions, ultimately producing a single-channel image \\( \\mathbf{x} \\).\n\nThe diagram clearly shows the flow of data and transformations, emphasizing the spatial transformation and convolutional steps essential to the methodology. This visualization is important for understanding the architecture and methodology used in the research, highlighting the transformation from 3D to 2D through structured processing pipelines.",

Each chart represents a different scenario with corresponding data:\n\n- **First Chart (Left):** Shows the performance bound in nats over generation steps (12, 24) for an \"Unconditional\" model and models with 1, 2, and 3 context views. A red line indicates the performance of a baseline model.\n\n- **Second Chart (Middle):** Similar structure, displaying performance for generation steps (2, 6, 12) with the same categories of models. The performance is compared against a baseline indicated by a red line.\n\n- **Third Chart (Right):** Also compares performance bounds over generation steps (2, 6, 12) for the same categories but in a different scenario, with the baseline model performance marked in red.\n\nThe bars indicate how the inclusion of context views impacts the performance relative to the baseline. The figure is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of adding context views at different generation steps, providing insight into the model's efficiency and scalability.",
