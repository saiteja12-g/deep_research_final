            "introduction": "The section from the research paper \"How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools\" by Qing Chen, Shixiong Cao, Jiazhe Wang, and Nan Cao provides an overview of the current state of automation in narrative visualization tools. This study categorizes narrative visualization into six genres: annotated charts, infographics, timelines & storylines, data comics, scrollytelling & slideshow, and data videos. It also classifies tools into four types based on their automation level: design spaces, authoring tools, ML/AI-supported tools, and ML/AI-generator tools.\n\nKey technical content includes:\n\n1. **Automation Levels and Tool Types**: \n   - **Design Spaces**: These provide frameworks for users to create narrative visualizations by guiding them through various design scenarios.\n   - **Authoring Tools**: These tools offer interactive features that allow users to manually control the visualization creation process.\n   - **ML/AI-Supported Tools**: These tools assist users by providing recommendations during the creation process, requiring users to make final design choices.\n   - **ML/AI-Generator Tools**: These tools can autonomously generate complete visualization designs without user intervention, reducing the need for user expertise.\n\n2. **Survey Methodology**: The study surveyed 105 papers and tools to analyze how automation can enhance the visualization design and narrative process. It identified 91 design spaces and tools across the six genres and classified them into four automation levels.\n\n3. **Comparison with Prior Work**: The paper notes that previous surveys have focused on automating traditional statistical charts, but there has been insufficient investigation into automation for narrative visualizations. This study aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of automation's role in narrative visualization tools.\n\n4. **Technical Limitations and Challenges**: The paper discusses the challenges of creating narrative visualizations, which typically require significant data analytic skills and visualization design expertise. It highlights the need for tools that reduce these barriers and the potential of ML/AI technologies to address these challenges.\n\n5. **Future Directions and Research Opportunities**: The study identifies both mature and less-explored areas in automated visual narrative tools, suggesting new research problems and future work to advance the field.\n\nThe paper does not provide specific formulas, equations, novel architectural details, or benchmark results with metrics, as it primarily focuses on surveying existing tools and categorizing them based on their automation capabilities. Additionally, it does not include a direct comparison of performance metrics with prior work, as the emphasis is on the classification and analysis of tools rather than empirical evaluation.",
            "methodology": "The \"RELATED SURVEY AND TAXONOMY\" section of the research paper provides a comprehensive review of narrative visualization literature and introduces relevant studies. It includes a detailed table (Table 1) that categorizes the design spaces and tools associated with major narrative visualization genres such as Annotated Chart, Infographic, Timeline & Storyline, Data Comics, Scrollytelling & Slideshow, and Data Video. The table highlights the number of publications or tools related to each genre, categorized by design space, ML/AI-supported tools, authoring tools, and ML/AI-generator tools, summing up to a total of 91 entries.\n\nThe section outlines the narrative visualization and storytelling process, as described by Lee et al. [6], which involves three main steps: investigating the data, making a story, and telling the story. This process is not strictly linear and involves a collection of narrative segments that are data-backed and presented coherently to achieve effective message delivery. Tong et al. [99] further explore the storytelling process in visualization, focusing on the logical concepts of the narrative visual's subject (creation tool and audience), the narration and transition methods, and the reasons for using visual narratives (memory and interpretation).\n\nWhile the section does not provide specific formulas, equations, or novel architectural details, it aims to offer an overview of the development and research of narrative visualization tools. It does not explicitly mention benchmark results, metrics, or comparisons with prior work, nor does it discuss technical limitations. The primary goal is to equip researchers and practitioners with a broad understanding of the field's evolution and the various tools available for narrative visualization.",
            "results": "The section \"2.2 Related Survey\" from the research paper provides an overview of existing surveys related to automated visualization techniques and tools, focusing on the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in visualization. Key contributions from prior surveys include:\n\n1. **Wang et al. [3]**: They surveyed 88 papers on ML4VIS, identifying seven main processes where machine learning is applied to visualization: Data Processing4VIS, Data-VIS Mapping, Insight Communication, Style Imitation, VIS Interaction, VIS Reading, and User Profiling.\n\n2. **Wu et al. [4]**: This survey reviewed recent advances in AI techniques applied to visual data, addressing key research questions about the development and management of visual data and the role of AI in these processes.\n\n3. **Zhu et al. [5]**: Their study focused on automated visualization techniques for infographics, which is the most relevant to the current research. However, they did not thoroughly analyze different levels of automation or how these tools assist in the design and creation of visual storytelling across various narrative forms.\n\nThe current research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of available design tools that can assist users in different design scenarios and identify areas for future research. It is influenced by narrative visualization theories and visual storytelling technologies, as outlined by Segel et al. [98], who describe narrative visualization as comprising narrative genres, narrative structure, and visual narrative.\n\n**Technical Limitations Mentioned**:\n- The section notes the lack of thorough analysis in previous work regarding the levels of automation in visualization tools and their impact on visual storytelling design processes.\n- The research excludes scientific visualization due to limited studies in narrative scientific visualization.\n\n**Comparison with Prior Work**:\n- The current research distinguishes itself by focusing on narrative visualization tools and identifying undeveloped research directions, unlike previous surveys that did not address these aspects comprehensively.\n\n**Methodology**:\n- The study used a combination of reference-driven and search-driven methods to compile a corpus of articles from visualization journals and conferences, ultimately narrowing down to 91 narrative visualization papers and tools after excluding programming tools and domain-specific application tools.\n\nNo specific formulas, equations, novel architectural details, or benchmark results are mentioned in this section. The focus is primarily on the scope, methodology, and gaps in existing research."
