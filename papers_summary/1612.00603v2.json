            "text": "1. Introduction\n\nAs we try to duplicate the successes of current deep convolutional architectures in the 3D domain, we face a fundamental representational issue. Extant deep net archi- tectures for both discriminative and generative learning in the signal domain are well suited to data that is regularly sampled, such as images, audio, or video. However, most common 3D geometry representations, such as 2D meshes or point clouds are not regular structures and do not easily ﬁt into architectures that exploit such regularity\n\nIn this paper we address the problem of generating the 3D geometry of an object based on a single image of that object. We explore generative networks for 3D geometry based on a point cloud representation. A point cloud representation may not be as efﬁcient in representing the underlying continuous 3D geometry as compared to a CAD model using geometric primitives or even a simple mesh, but for our purposes it has many advantages, A point cloud is a simple, uniform structure that is easier to learn, as it does not have to encode multiple primitives or combi- natorial connectivity patterns. In addition, a point cloud allows simple manipulation when it comes to geometric transformations and deformations, as connectivity does not\n\n∗equal contribution\n\n1\n\nhave to be updated. Our pipeline infers the point positions in a 3D frame determined by the input image and the inferred viewpoint position.\n\nGiven this unorthodox network output, one of our chal- lenges is how to measure loss during training, as the same geometry may admit different point cloud representations at the same degree of approximation. Unlike the usual L2 type losses, we use the solution of a transportation problem based on the Earth Mover’s distance (EMD), effectively solving an assignment problem. We exploit an approximation to the EMD to provide speed as well as ensure differentiability for end-to-end training.\n\nOur approach effectively attempts to solve the ill-posed problem of 3D structure recovery from a single projection using certain learned priors. The network has to estimate depth for the visible parts of the image and hallucinate the rest of the object geometry, assessing the plausibility of sev- eral different completions. From a statistical perspective, it would be ideal if we can fully characterize the landscape of the ground truth space, or be able to sample plausible candidates accordingly. If we view this as a regression problem, then it has a rather unique and interesting feature arising from inherent object ambiguities in certain views. These are situations where there are multiple, equally good 3D reconstructions of a 2D image, making our problem very different from classical regression/classiﬁcation settings, where each training sample has a unique ground truth annotation. In such settings the proper loss deﬁnition can be crucial in getting the most meaningful result.\n\nOur ﬁnal algorithm is a conditional sampler, which samples plausible 3D point clouds from the estimated ground truth space given an input image. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data verify the effectiveness of our method. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n• We are the ﬁrst to study the point set generation problem by deep learning;\n\n• On the task of 3D reconstruction from a single image, we apply our point set generation network and signiﬁcantly outperform state of the art;\n\n• We systematically explore issues in the architecture and loss function design for point generation network;\n\n• We propose a principled formulation and solution to address the groundtruth ambiguity issue for the 3D reconstruction from single image task.",

            "text": "4. Approach\n\n4.1. Overview\n\nOur task of building a conditional generative network for point sets is challenging, due to the unordered form of representation and the inherent ambiguity of groundtruth. These challenges has pushed us to invent new architecture, loss function, and learning paradigm. Speciﬁcally, we have to address three subproblems:\n\nPoint set generator architecture: Network to predict point set is barely studied in literature, leaving a huge open space for us to explore the design choices. Ideally, a network should make the best use of its data statistics and possess enough representation power. We propose a\n\n1Similar to the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network [17].\n\nModeling the uncertainty of groundtruth: Our problem of 3D structural recovery from a single image is ill- posed, thus the ambiguity of groundtruth arises during the train and test time. It is fundamentally important to characterize the ambiguity of groundtruth for a given input, and practically desirable to be able to generate multiple predictions. Surprisingly, this goal can be achieved tactfully by simply using the min function as a wrapper to the above proposed loss, or by a conditional variational autoencoder. See Sec 4.4.\n\n4.2. Point Set Prediction Network\n\nThe task of building a network for point set prediction is new. We design a network with the goal of possessing strong representation power for complicated structures, and make the best use of the statistics of geometric data. To introduce our network progressively, we start from a simple version and gradually add components.\n\nAs in Fig 2 (top), our network has an encoder stage and a predictor stage. The encoder maps the input pair of an image I and a random vector r into an embedding space.\n\nThe predictor outputs a shape as an N × 3 matrix M, each row containing the coordinates of one point.\n\nThe encoder is a composition of convolution and ReLU layers; in addition, a random vector r is subsumed so that it perturbs the prediction from the image I. We postpone the explanation of how r is used to Sec 4.4. The predictor generates the coordinates of N points through a fully connected network. Though simple, this version works reasonably well in practice.\n\nWe further improve the design of the predictor branch to better accommodate large and smooth surfaces which are common in natural objects. The fully connected predictor as above cannot make full use of such natural geometric statistics, since each point is predicted independently. The improved predictor in Fig 2 (middle) exploits this geometric smoothness property.\n\nThis version has two parallel predictor branches – a fully-connected (fc) branch and a deconvolution (deconv) branch. The fc branch predicts N1 points as before. The deconv branch predicts a 3 channel image of size H × W, of which the three values at each pixel are the coordinates of a point, giving another H × W points. Their predictions are later merged together to form the whole set of points in M. Multiple skip links are added to boost information ﬂow across encoder and predictor.\n\nWith the fc branch, our model enjoys high ﬂexibility, showing good performance at describing intricate struc- tures. With the deconvolution branch, our model becomes not only more parameter parsimonious by weight sharing; but also more friendly to large smooth surfaces, due to the spatial continuity induced by deconv and conv. Refer to Sec 5.5 for experimental evidences.\n\nTo pursue even better performance, we introduce the hourglass version in Fig 2 (bottom), inspired by [18]. This deep network conducts the encoding-decoding operations recurrently, thus has stronger representation power and can mix global and local information better.\n\nAbove introduces the design of our network G in Eq 1. To train this network, however, we still need to design a proper loss function for point set prediction, and enable the role r for multiple candidates prediction. We explain in the next two sections.",

For real world photo, we mask out background pixels to indicate the object. Our algorithm gives promising result though trained on synthetic data only. We plot the reconstruction results of the ﬁrst 5 mini-batches (160 cases in total) of our validation set at the end of this paper in Fig 19. Results produced by the network trained by CD and EMD are compared side-by-side. Owing to the diversity in the ShapeNet dataset, our system is able to handle a variety of object types.\n\nSynthetic Data Real World Data —— i\n\nFigure 13.

We also overlaid a wire-frame rendering of the object on the input image (top) to facilitate alignment.\n\n5.7. Analysis of human ability for single view 3D reconstruction\n\nof the network’s reconstruction are on par with human’s manual creation for most of the cases. We observed that the human subject mainly used cues of gravity direction (legs of chairs should touch the ground) and symmetry to infer the object’s shape. As illustrated in input image number 4, 9 and 15, when the object is partially occluded (the table blocks the chair), ambiguous (it is unclear whether the can has a bottom) or manifests inadequate geometric cues (the guitar has non-polygonal shape and does not sit on the ground) the human subject performs poorly. The neural network trained by EMD performs reasonably well under both metrics. However, because CD emphasises only on the best matching point, the network trained by CD does not always produce predictions of uniform density and suffers high EMD value in some cases.\n\nWe conducted human study to provide reference to our current CD and EMD values reported on the rendered dataset. We provided the human subject with a GUI tool to create a triangular mesh from the image. The tool (see Fig 16) enables the user to edit the mesh in 3D and to align the modeled object back to the input image. In total 16 models are created from the input images of our validation set. N = 1024 points are sampled from each model.\n\nAs shown in Fig 17, both the EMD and the CD values",

We take the approach of rendering 2D views from CAD object models.

Our method gives better results on all three metrics.\n\nmodels with textures. Concretely we used a subset of 220K models covering 2,000 object categories. The use of synthesized data has been adopted in a number of existing works [5, 19].\n\nFor each model, we normalized the radius of its bound- ing hemi-sphere to unit 1 and aligned their ground plane. Then each model was rendered into 2D images according to the Blinn-Phong shading formula with randomly chosen environmental maps. In our experiments we used a simple local lightening model for the sake of computation time. However, it is straight-forward to extend our method to incorporate global illumination algorithms and more complex backgrounds.\n\n5.2. 3D Shape Reconstruction from RGB Images\n\nComparison to state-of-the-art We compare our work to 3D-R2N2[5] which is the state-of-the-art in deep learn- ing based 3D object generation. 3D-R2N2 reconstructs 3D from single or multi-view images into a volumetric representation. To enable the comparison we re-trained our networks on the dataset used by 3D-R2N2’s authors. The results are compared under three different metrics CD, EMD and IoU (intersection over union). In 3D-R2N2 only IoU values are reported, so we used the trained network provided by the authors to compute their predictions. To compute CD and EMD, their predicted and ground truth volumes are sampled by iterative farthest point sampling [8] to a discrete set of points with the same cardinality as ours. We post-processed our point-set into a volumetric one with the same resolution as in 3D-R2N2 when computing IoU. Refer to Sec 5.9 for details.\n\nIn Fig 7 we report the result of our network compared with the single-view 3D-R2N2. To determine the absolute scale of CD and EMD we deﬁne unit 1 as 1/10 of the length of the 3D grid used to encode the ground truth shape in 3D-R2N2’s dataset. Though not directly trained by IoU, our network gives signiﬁcantly better performance under all three measures.\n\nWe report the IoU value for each category as in [5]. From Table 1, we can see that the for single view reconstruction the proposed method consistently achieves higher IoU in all\n\ncategory Ours 3D-R2N2 1 view 1 view 3 views 5 views plane 0.601 0.513 0.549 0.561 bench 0.550 0.421 0.502 0.527 cabinet 0.771 0.716 0.763 0.772 car 0.831 0.798 0.829 0.836 chair 0.544 0.466 0.533 0.550 monitor 0.552 0.468 0.545 0.565 lamp 0.462 0.381 0.415 0.421 speaker 0.737 0.662 0.708 0.717 ﬁrearm 0.604 0.544 0.593 0.600 couch 0.708 0.628 0.690 0.706 table 0.606 0.513 0.564 0.580 cellphone 0.749 0.661 0.732 0.754 watercraft 0.611 0.513 0.596 0.610 mean 0.640 0.560 0.617 0.631\n\nTable 1. 3D reconstruction comparison (per category).

On many categories our method even outperforms the 3D-R2N2’s prediction given 5 views.\n\nTo further contrast the two methods, we visualize some typical examples. As stated in [5], their method often misses thin features of objects (e.g. legs of furnitures). We surmise that this is due to their volumetric represen- tation and voxel-wise loss function which unduly punishes mispositioned thin structures. In contrast, our point-cloud based objective function encourages the preservation of ﬁne structures and makes our predictions more structurally plausible.",

Because we have not implemented any detection or attention mechanism, the networks produce distorted output.\n\n5.9. Implementation details\n\nNetwork parameter and training Our network works on input images of 192x256. The deconv branch produces 768 points, which correspond to a 32x24 three-channel image. The fully connected branch produces 256 points. The convolutional layer has 16 feature maps in the highest resolution, and the number of channels are doubled after each decrease in resolution. We use strided convolution instead of max-pooling to increase speed. The training pro- gram is implemented in TensorFlow. 300000 gradient steps are taken, each computed from a minibatch of 32. Adam is used as the optimizer. We observed that the training procedure is smooth even without batch normalization. All activation functions are relu.\n\nPost processing We use a local method to post process the point cloud into a volumetric representation. First, the point cloud is registered into the 32x32x32 grid with bilinear interpolation. This can be think of as interpreting the points as 1x1x1 cubes and averaging the intersection volume with each grid cell (the occupancy representation). Then each voxel exams a local neighborhood to determine the ﬁnal value. We implement this as a trained 3D convolutinoal neural network with 6 layers of 3x3x3 convolutions. This post-processing network is trained by IoU on the same training partition as the point cloud generation network. In order to compensate for difference in point density among objects of different volumes, we trained another network to predict the object’s volume. The predicted volume is concatenated with the registered occupancy as the 3D conv network’s input. Using the point cloud generation network trained by either EMD or CD to is enough to outperform 3D-R2N2’s result. The maximum performance as reported in the main paper is obtained by feeding both network’s prediction into the post processing network. We also notice that the volume prediction network is not necessary to outperform 3D-R2N2. However, it consistently gives performance gain, so we kept this component in our experiments.",

Posed as a regression problem, ambiguity of the prediction arises at test time – the depth for visible parts is under-determined, and the geometry for invisible parts has to be hallucinated by guessing. In a statistical view, reasonable predictions from the input image form a distribution. Reﬂected in the training set, two images that look alike may have rather different groundtruth shapes. Recall the discussion in the previous section – the ambiguity of groundtruth shape may signiﬁcantly affect the trained predictor, as the loss function\n\npoint cloud generation distribution modeling Mo2 / VAE a. “input > point cloud loss CD / EMD > Point Set Prediction Network\n\nFigure 4. System structure. By plugging in distributional modeling module, our system is capable of generating multiple predictions.\n\n(2) induces our model to predict the mean of possible shapes.\n\nTo better model the uncertainty or inherent ambiguity (e.g. unseen parts in the single view), we enable the system to generate distributional output. We expect that the random variable r passed to G (see Eq (1)) would help it explore the groundtruth distribution, in analogy to conditional GAN (CGAN) [17]. However, naively plugging G from Eq (1) into Loss (2) to predict Spred i won’t work, as the loss minimization will nullify the randomness. It is also unclear how to make CGAN work in our scenario, as building a discriminator that directly consumes a point set is itself an open problem.\n\nThe problem can be solved by more complex frame- works like VAE, where we can incorporate secondary input channels (e.g. another view). However, we ﬁnd practically a simple and effective method for uncertainty modeling: the MoN loss. We train our network by minimizing a loss function as below:\n\nminimize Θ k min rj∼N(0,I) 1≤j≤n {d(G(Ik,rj;Θ),Sgt k )} (3)\n\nWe explain the rationale behind Problem (3) here. Given an image Ik, G makes n predictions by perturbing the input with n random vectors rj. Intuitively, we expect that one of the predictions will be close to the groundtruth Sgt k given by the training data, meaning that the minimum of the n distances between each prediction and the groundtruth must be small.\n\nWe name this loss as Min-of-N loss (MoN), since it comes from the minimum of n distances. Any of the point set regression networks in Fig 2 can be plugged into the meta network in Fig 4 incorporating the MoN loss. In practice, we ﬁnd that setting n = 2 already enables our method to well explore the groundtruth space. Please refer to Sec 5.4 for experiment results.\n\nAn alternative way to achieve the conditional shape sampler is by a conditional variational autoencoder. For more details about variational autoencoders, please refer to [6]. Fig 5 shows the system architecture for training and testing a conditional variational autoencoder P(S|X) in our case.

The majority of extant works resort to regular representations such as volumetric grids or collection of images; however, these representations obscure the natural invariance of 3D shapes under geometric transformations, and also suffer from a number of other issues. In this paper we address the problem of 3D reconstruction from a single image, generating a straight-forward form of output – point cloud coordinates. Along with this problem arises a unique and interesting issue, that the groundtruth shape for an input image may be ambiguous. Driven by this unorthodox output form and the inherent ambiguity in groundtruth, we design architecture, loss function and learning paradigm that are novel and effective. Our ﬁnal solution is a conditional shape sampler, capable of predicting multiple plausible 3D point clouds from an input image. In experiments not only can our system outperform state-of- the-art methods on single image based 3d reconstruction benchmarks; but it also shows strong performance for 3d shape completion and promising ability in making multiple plausible predictions.\n\nInput Reconstructed 3D point cloud\n\nFigure 1. A 3D point cloud of the complete object can be reconstructed from a single image. Each point is visualized as a small sphere. The reconstruction is viewed at two viewpoints (0◦ and 90◦ along azimuth). A segmentation mask is used to indicate the scope of the object in the image.\n\nfor weight sharing, etc. That is why the majority of extant works on using deep nets for 3D data resort to either volumetric grids or collections of images (2D views of the geometry). Such representations, however, lead to difﬁcult trade offs between sampling resolution and net efﬁciency. Furthermore, they enshrine quantization artifacts that obscure natural invariances of the data under rigid motions, etc.",

Related Work\n\n3D reconstruction from single images While most researches focus on multi-view geometry such as SFM and SLAM [11, 10], ideally, one expect that 3D can be reconstructed from the abundant single-view images.\n\nUnder this setting, however, the problem is ill-posed and priors must be incorporated. Early work such as ShapeFromX [13, 1] made strong assumptions over the shape or the environment lighting conditions. [12, 21] pioneered the use of learning-based approach for simple geometric structures. Coarse correspondences in an image collection can also be used for rough 3D shape estima- tion [15, 3]. As commodity 3D sensors become popular, RGBD database has been built and used to train learning- based systems [7, 9]. Though great progress has been made, these methods still cannot robustly reconstruct complete and quality shapes from single images. Stronger shape priors are missing.\n\nRecently, large-scale repositories of 3D CAD models, such as ShapeNet [4], have been introduced. They have great potential for 3D reconstruction tasks. For example, [22, 14] proposed to deform and reassemble existing shapes into a new model to ﬁt the observed image. These systems rely on high-quality image-shape correspondence, which is a challenging and ill-posed problem itself.\n\nMore relevant to our work is [5]. Given a single image, they use a neural network to predict the underlying 3D object as a 3D volume. There are two key differences between our work and [5]: First, the predicted object in [5] is a 3D volume; whilst ours is a point cloud. As demonstrated and analyzed in Sec 5.2, point set forms a nicer shape space for neural networks, thus the predicted shapes tend to be more complete and natural. Second, we allow multiple reconstruction candidates for a single input image. This design reﬂects the fact that a single image cannot fully determine the reconstruction of a 3D shape.\n\nDeep learning for geometric object synthesis In gen- eral, the ﬁeld of how to predict geometries in an end-to-end fashion is quite a virgin land. In particular, our output, 3D point set, is still not a typical object in the deep learning community. A point set contains orderless samples from a metric-measure space. Therefore, equivalent classes are deﬁned up to a permutation; in addition, the ground distance must be taken into consideration. To our knowledge, we are not aware of prior deep learning systems with the abilities to predict such objects.",

We represent the 3D shapes in the form of unordered point set S = {(xi,yi,zi)}N i=1 where N is a predeﬁned constant. We observed that for most objects using N = 1024 is sufﬁcient to preserve the major structures.\n\nOne advantage of point set comes from its unordered- ness. Unlike 2D based representations like the depth map no topological constraint is put on the represented\n\nvanilla version two prediction branch version hourglass version\n\nFigure 2.

Also, the coordinate values (xi,yi,zi) go over simple linear transformations when the object is rotated or scaled, which is in contrast to the case in volumetric representations.\n\nTo model the problem’s uncertainty, we deﬁne the groundtruth as a probability distribution P(·|I) over the shapes conditioned on the input I. In training we have access to one sample from P(·|I) for each image I.\n\nWe train a neural network G as a conditional sampler from P(·|I):\n\nS = G(I,r;Θ) (1)\n\nnetwork with two prediction branches, one enjoys high ﬂexibility in capturing complicated structures and the other exploits geometric continuity. Its representation power is further boosted by an hourglass structure. See Sec 4.2.\n\nLoss function for point set comparison: For our novel type of prediction, point set, it is unclear how to measure the distance between the prediction and groundtruth. We introduce two distance metrics for point sets – the Chamfer distance and the Earth Mover’s distance. We show that both metrics are differentiable almost everywhere and can be used as the loss function, but has different properties in capturing shape space. See Sec 4.3.\n\nwhere Θ denotes network parameter, r ∼ N(0,I) is a random variable to perturb the input 1. During test time multiple samples of r could be used to generate different predictions.",

            "text": "4.3. Distance Metric between Point Sets\n\nA critical challenge is to design a good loss function for comparing the predicted point cloud and the groundtruth. To plug in a neural network, a suitable distance must satisfy at least three conditions: 1) differentiable with respect to point locations; 2) efﬁcient to compute, as data will be forwarded and back-propagated for many times; 3) robust against small number of outlier points in the sets (e.g. Hausdorff distance would fail).\n\nWe seek for a distance d between subsets in R3, so that\n\nthe loss function L({Spred i },{Sgt i }) takes the form\n\nL({Spred i },{Sgt i }) = d(Spred i ,Sgt i ), (2)\n\nwhere i indexes training samples, Spred i and Sgt i are the prediction and groundtruth of each sample, respectively.\n\nWe propose two candidates: Chamfer distance (CD) and Earth Mover’s distance (EMD) [20].\n\nChamfer distance We deﬁne the Chamfer distance be- tween S1,S2 ⊆ R3 as:\n\ndop($1.$2) = J) min |e — y+ SO min le ~ yl 2ES, ye Sy”\n\nIn the strict sense, dCD is not a distance function because triangle inequality does not hold. We nevertheless use the term “distance” to refer to any non-negative function deﬁned on point set pairs. For each point, the algorithm of CD ﬁnds the nearest neighbor in the other set and sums the squared distances up. Viewed as a function of point locations in S1 and S2, CD is continuous and piecewise smooth. The range search for each point is independent, thus trivially parallelizable. Also, spatial data structures like KD-tree can be used to accelerate nearest neighbor search. Though simple, CD produces reasonable high quality results in practice.\n\nEarth Mover’s distance Consider S1,S2 ⊆ R3 of equal size s = |S1| = |S2|. The EMD between A and B is deﬁned as:\n\ndgup(Si,52) = min >» lx — o¢ 2)|l2 S14 So\n\nwhere φ : S1 → S2 is a bijection.\n\nThe EMD distance solves an optimization problem, namely, the assignment problem. For all but a zero- measure subset of point set pairs, the optimal bijection ¢ is unique and invariant under infinitesimal movement of the points. Thus EMD is differentiable almost everywhere. In practice, exact computation of EMD is too expensive for deep learning, even on graphics hardware. We therefore implement a (1 + €) approximation scheme given by [2]. We allocate fix amount of time for each instance and incrementally adjust allowable error ratio to ensure termination. For typical inputs, the algorithm gives highly accurate results (approximation error on the magnitude of 1%). The algorithm is easily parallelizable on GPU.\n\nShape space Despite remarkable expressive power em- bedded in the deep layers, neural networks inevitably encounter uncertainty in predicting the precise geometry of an object. Such uncertainty could arise from limited\n\n“A / ( ey = we ° ye fh\n\nInput “A / ( °\n\n“A / ( ey = we ° ye fh\n\n= we ye fh\n\nEMD mean QO _f\n\nEMD mean QO\n\nQO _f\n\ncD mean\n\n(a) (b) (©)\n\n(b) (©) (d)\n\ncD mean (a)\n\nFigure 3.

The shape distributions are (a) a circle with varying radius; (b) a spiky arc moving along the diagonal; (c) a rectangle bar, with a square- shaped attachment allocated randomly on one of the four corners; (d) a bar, with a circular disk appearing next to it with probability 0.5. The red dots plot the mean shape calculated according to EMD and CD accordingly.\n\nnetwork capacity, insufﬁcient use of input resolution, or the ambiguity of groundtruth due to information loss in 3D-2D projection. Facing the inherent inability to resolve the shape precisely, neural networks tend to predict a “mean” shape averaging out the space of uncertainty. The mean shape carries the characteristics of the distance itself.\n\nIn Figure 3, we illustrate the distinct mean-shape be- havior of EMD and CD on synthetic shape distributions, by minimizing Es∼S[L(x,s)] through stochastic gradient descent, where S is a given shape distribution, L is one of the distance functions.\n\nIn the ﬁrst and the second case, there is a single continuously changing hidden variable, namely the radius of the circle in (a) and the location of the arc in (b). EMD roughly captures the shape corresponding to the mean value of the hidden variable. In contrast CD induces a splashy shape that blurs the shape’s geometric structure. In the latter two cases, there are categorical hidden variables: which corner the square is located at (c) and whether there is a circle besides the bar (d). To address the uncertain presence of the varying part, the minimizer of CD distributes some points outside the main body at the correct locations; while the minimizer of EMD is considerably distorted.",

When the neural network is given RGBD input our system can be viewed as a 3D shape completion method. Fig 8 visualizes examples of the predictions.\n\nThe neural network successfully guesses the missing parts of the model. By using the shape priors embedded in the object repository, the system can leverage cues of both symmetry (e.g. airplanes should have symetric sides) and functionality (tractors should have wheels). The ﬂexible representation of point set facilitates the resolution of the object’s general shape and topology. More ﬁne-grained methods that directly exploit local geometric cues could be cascaded after our predictions to enrich higher frequency details.\n\n5.4. Predicting Multiple Plausible Shapes\n\nThe randomness in our network enables prediction of different shapes given the same input image. To show this, we take the RGB image as the input. During training we handle randomness by using either the Mo2 or the VAE method. At test time when the ground truth is unknown, the random numbers are sampled from the predeﬁned distribution.\n\nFig 9 plots examples of the set of predictions of our method. The network is able to reveal its uncertainty\n\nabout the shape or the ambiguity in the input. Points that the neural network is certain about its position moves little between different predictions. Along the direction of ambiguity (e.g. the thickness of the penguin’s body) the variation is signiﬁcantly larger. In this ﬁgure we trained our network with Mo2 and Chamfer Distance. In Fig 10, we visualize the results of VAE. Compared to the result of Mo2, the prediction of VAE looks plumper; however, it also captures the local directions of ambiguity in the shape.",

In Fig 11 the values in the x, y and z channels are plotted as 2D images for one of the models. In the deconv branch the network learns to use the convolution structure to constructs a 2D surface that warps around the object. In the fully connected branch the output is less organized as the channels are not ordered.\n\nIn Fig 12 we render the two set of predictions in 3D space.

The predeﬁned weights sharing and node connectivity endow the deconv branch with higher efﬁciency when they are congruent with the desired output’s structure. The fully connected branch is more ﬂexible but the independent control of each point consumes more network capacity.\n\nAnalysis of distance metrics Different choices of the loss functions have distinct effect on the network’s prediction pattern. Fig 15 exempliﬁes the difference between two networks trained by CD and EMD correspondingly. The network trained by CD tends to scatter a few points in its uncertain area (e.g. behind the door) but is able to better preserve the detailed shape of the grip. In contrast, the network trained by EMD produces more compact results but sometimes overly shrinks local structures. This is in line with experiment on synthetic data.\n\nFigure 15.

The decoder takes input \\( X \\) and produces output through a function \\( f(z, X) \\).\n\n- **Graphs, Charts, and Data Visualizations**: There are no graphs or charts; the figure is a flow diagram illustrating the data and process flow within the model.\n\n- **Mathematical Formulas or Concepts**: The formula \\(\\text{KLD}[\\mathcal{N}(\\mu(Y, X), \\Sigma(Y, X)) \\parallel \\mathcal{N}(0, I)]\\) indicates the use of Kullback-Leibler Divergence for measuring the difference between two probability distributions, which is a common regularization technique in variational inference.\n\n- **Algorithm Flowcharts or Processes**: The figure shows the flow of data through the model, starting from the input \\( Y \\), moving through the encoder, sampling from a normal distribution, and then through the decoder to generate output. The process also involves combining the encoded and sampled data before decoding.\n\n- **Results or Findings**: The figure primarily illustrates methodology rather than explicit results. It outlines a generative process involving sampling and reconstruction, focusing on how the encoder and decoder interact.\n\nThe figure is important for understanding the methodology and architecture of the model described in the research.",

            "description": "This figure appears to show a series of 3D models, each organized into rows and columns, illustrating a transformation or progression. Each row consists of four images, likely representing different stages or components of a process related to 3D object manipulation or generation. The first column in each row shows a silhouette or simplified version of an object, possibly indicating an initial input or base model. The second column displays a more detailed, textured version of the object, perhaps demonstrating an intermediate stage or a rendered outcome. The third column seems to depict a partially deconstructed or differently textured version, which might highlight a transformation or comparison. The fourth column appears to show an object with a distinctive texture or composition, indicating a final or altered state.\n\nThe objects in each row include different categories: chairs, vehicles, and airplanes. This suggests the figure is showcasing the application of a method across diverse object types. The figure likely serves to illustrate a technique in generating or processing 3D models, relevant to areas such as computer graphics, machine learning, or computational design. Given its comprehensive depiction of methodology and results across multiple examples, it is an important figure for understanding the research's scope and application.",
