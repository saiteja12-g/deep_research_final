            "text": "1 Introduction\n\nHolistic 3D scene understanding from a single RGB image is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision problem, while humans are capable of performing such tasks effortlessly within 200 ms [Potter, 1975, 1976, Schyns and Oliva, 1994, Thorpe et al., 1996]. The primary difﬁculty of the holistic 3D scene understanding lies in the vast, but ambiguous 3D information attempted to recover from a single RGB image. Such estimation includes three essential tasks:\n\n• The estimation of the 3D camera pose that captures the image. This component helps to maintain the consistency between the 2D image and the 3D world.\n\n• The estimation of the 3D room layout. Combining with the estimated 3D camera pose, it recovers a\n\nglobal geometry.\n\nThe estimation of the 3D bounding boxes for each object in the scene, recovering the local details.\n\nMost current methods either are inefﬁcient or only tackle the problem partially. Speciﬁcally,\n\n• Traditional methods [Gupta et al., 2010, Zhao and Zhu, 2011, 2013, Choi et al., 2013, Schwing et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2014, Izadinia et al., 2017, Huang et al., 2018] apply sampling or optimization methods to infer the geometry and semantics of indoor scenes. However, those methods are computationally expensive; it usually takes a long time to converge and could be easily trapped in 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018), Montréal, Canada.\n\n(a) 2D detection\n\nEstimate\n\nLocal object\n\nGlobal geometry !\n\n(b)\n\nProject Bounding box parameterization Camera Holistic 3D inference\n\n(c) 2D projection\n\n2D Supervision\n\nFigure 1: Overview of the proposed framework for cooperative holistic scene understanding. (a) We ﬁrst detect 2D objects and generate their bounding boxes, given a single RGB image as the input, from which (b) we can estimate 3D object bounding boxes, 3D room layout, and 3D camera pose. The blue bounding box is the estimated 3D room layout. (c) We project 3D objects to the image plane with the learned camera pose, forcing the projection from the 3D estimation to be consistent with 2D estimation.\n\nan unsatisfactory local minimum, especially for cluttered indoor environments. Thus both stability and scalability become issues.\n\n• Recently, researchers attempt to tackle this problem using deep learning. The most straightforward way is to directly predict the desired targets (e.g., 3D room layouts or 3D bounding boxes) by training the individual modules separately with isolated losses for each module. Thereby, the prior work [Mousavian et al., 2017, Lee et al., 2017, Kehl et al., 2017, Kundu et al., 2018, Zou et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2018] only focuses on the individual tasks or learn these tasks separately rather than jointly inferring all three tasks, or only considers the inherent relations without explicitly modeling the connections among them [Tulsiani et al., 2018].\n\n• Another stream of approach takes both an RGB-D image and the camera pose as the input [Lin et al., 2013, Song and Xiao, 2014, 2016, Song et al., 2017, Deng and Latecki, 2017, Zou et al., 2017, Qi et al., 2018, Lahoud and Ghanem, 2017, Zhang et al., 2017a], which provides sufﬁcient geometric information from the depth images, thereby relying less on the consistency among different modules.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to address the missing piece in the literature: to recover a geometrically consistent and physically plausible 3D scene and jointly solve all three tasks in an efﬁcient and cooperative way, only from a single RGB image. Speciﬁcally, we tackle three important problems:\n\n1. 2D-3D consistency A good solution to the aforementioned three tasks should maintain a high consistency between the 2D image plane and the 3D world coordinate. How should we design a method to achieve such consistency?\n\n2. Cooperation Psychological studies have shown that our biologic perception system is extremely good at rapid scene understanding [Schyns and Oliva, 1994], particularly utilizing the fusion of different visual cues [Landy et al., 1995, Jacobs, 2002]. Such ﬁndings support the necessities of cooperatively solving all the holistic scene tasks together. Can we devise an algorithm such that it can cooperatively solve these tasks, making different modules reinforce each other?\n\n3. Physically Plausible As humans, we excel in inferring the physical attributes and dynamics [Kubricht et al., 2017]. Such a deep understanding of the physical environment is imperative, especially for an interactive agent (e.g., a robot) to navigate the environment or collaborate with a human agent. How can the model estimate a 3D scene in a physically plausible fashion, or at least\n\nhave some sense of physics?\n\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel parametrization of the 3D bounding box as well as a set of cooperative losses. Speciﬁcally, we parametrize the 3D boxes by the predicted camera pose and object attributes from individual modules. Hence, we can construct the 3D boxes starting from the 2D box centers to maintain a 2D-3D consistency, rather than predicting 3D coordinates directly or assuming the camera pose is given, which loses the 2D-3D consistency.\n\nCooperative losses are further imposed on the parametrization in addition to the direct losses to enable the joint training of all the individual modules. Speciﬁcally, we employ three cooperative losses on the parametrization to constrain the 3D bounding boxes, projected 2D bounding boxes, and physical plausibility, respectively:\n\n• The 3D bounding box loss encourages accurate 3D estimation.\n\n• The differentiable 2D projection loss measures the consistency between 3D and 2D bounding boxes, which permits our networks to learn the 3D structures with only 2D annotations (i.e., no 3D\n\n2\n\nInput Model c T ' Input i a | put image 3D room layout Physical | Image |—*|Global Geometry Network Constraints | - Se camenpae mr | | Detected Local Object Network | 2D Boxes | —» a i ©» Orientation —4 3D Boxes L3p | Camera Projection Lp roy ini Size paca rize | 3D Box t i\n\n(a) Network architecture",

            "text": "2 Method\n\nIn this section, we describe the parametrization of the 3D bounding boxes and the neural networks designed for the 3D holistic scene understanding. The proposed model consists of two networks, shown in Figure 2: a global geometric network (GGN) that estimates the 3D room layout and camera pose, and a local object network (LON) that infers the attributes of each object. Based on these two networks, we further formulate differentiable loss functions to train the two networks cooperatively.\n\n2.1 Parametrization\n\n3D Objects We use the 3D bounding box XW ∈ R3×8 as the representation of the estimated 3D object in the world coordinate. The 3D bounding box is described by its 3D center CW ∈ R3, size SW ∈ R3, and orientation R(θW) ∈ R3×3: XW = h(CW,R(θW),S), where θ is the heading angle along the up-axis, and h(·) is the function that composes the 3D bounding box.\n\n3\n\nWithout any depth information, estimating 3D object center CW directly from the 2D image may result in a large variance of the 3D bounding box estimation. To alleviate this issue and bridge the gap between 2D and 3D object bounding boxes, we parametrize the 3D center CW by its corresponding 2D bounding box center CI ∈ R2 on the image plane, distance D between the camera center and the 3D object center, the camera intrinsic parameter K ∈ R3×3, and the camera extrinsic parameters R(φ,ψ) ∈ R3×3 and T ∈ R3, where φ and ψ are the camera rotation angles. As illustrated in Figure 2(b), since each 2D bounding box and its corresponding 3D bounding box are both manually annotated, there is always an offset δI ∈ R2 between the 2D box center and the projection of 3D box center. Therefore, the 3D object center CW can be computed as\n\nKel +641 K-1[cl +544\" \\’ CW =T + DR(¢,¥)7+ (1)\n\nSince T becomes 0 when the data is captured from the first-person view, the above equation could be\n\nwritten as CW = p(CI,δI,D,φ,ψ,K), where p is a differentiable projection function.\n\nIn this way, the parametrization of the 3D object bounding box unites the 3D object center CW and 2D object center CI, which helps maintain the 2D-3D consistency and reduces the variance of the 3D bounding box estimation. Moreover, it integrates both object attributes and camera pose, promoting the cooperative training of the two networks.\n\n3D Room Layout Similar to 3D objects, we parametrize 3D room layout in the world coordinate as a 3D bounding box XL ∈ R3×8, which is represented by its 3D center CL ∈ R3, size SL ∈ R3, and orientation R(θL) ∈ R3×3, where θL is the rotation angle. In this paper, we estimate the room layout center by predicting the offset from the pre-computed average layout center.",

Following the evaluation protocol deﬁned in [Song et al., 2015], we compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) between the free space of the ground truth and the free space estimated by the proposed method. Table 1 shows our model outperforms HoPR by 2.0%. The results further show that there is an additional 1.5% performance improvement compared with individual training, demonstrating the efﬁcacy of our method. Note that IM2CAD [Izadinia et al., 2017] manually selected 484 images from 794 test images of living rooms and bedrooms. For fair comparisons, we evaluate our method on the entire set of living room and bedrooms, outperforming IM2CAD by 2.1%.\n\n3D Object Detection We evaluate our 3D object detection results using the metrics deﬁned in [Song et al., 2015]. Speciﬁcally, the mean average precision (mAP) is computed using the 3D IoU between the predicted and the ground truth 3D bounding boxes. In the absence of depth, the threshold of IoU is adjusted from 0.25 (evaluation setting with depth image input) to 0.15 to determine whether two bounding boxes are overlapped. The 3D object detection results are reported in Table 2. We report 10 out of 30 object categories here, and the rest are reported in the supplementary materials. The results indicate our method outperforms HoPR by 9.64% on mAP and improves the individual training result by 8.41%. Compared with the model using individual training, the proposed cooperative model makes a signiﬁcant improvement, especially on small objects such as bins and lamps. The accuracy of the estimation easily inﬂuences 3d detection of small objects; oftentimes, it is nearly impossible for prior approaches to detect. In contrast, beneﬁting from the parametrization method and 2D projection loss, the proposed cooperative model maintains the consistency between 3D and 2D, substantially reducing the estimation variance. Note that although IM2CAD also evaluates the 3D detection, they use a metric related to a speciﬁc distance threshold. For fair comparisons, we further conduct experiments on the subset of living rooms and bedrooms, using the same object categories with respect to this particular metric rather than an IoU threshold. We obtain an mAP of 78.8%, 4.2% higher than the results reported in IM2CAD.\n\n3D Box Estimation The 3D object detection performance of our model is determined by both the 2D object detection and the 3D bounding box estimation. We ﬁrst evaluate the accuracy of the 3D bounding box estimation, which reﬂects the ability to predict 3D boxes from 2D image patches. Instead of using mAP, 3D IoU is directly computed between the ground truth and the estimated 3D boxes for each object category. To evaluate the 2D-3D consistency, the estimated 3D boxes are projected back to 2D, and the 2D IoU is evaluated between the projected and detected 2D boxes. Results using the full model are reported in Table 3, which shows 3D estimation is still under satisfactory, despite the efforts to maintain a good 2D-3D consistency. The underlying reason for the gap between 3D and 2D performance is the increased estimation dimension. Another possible reason is due to the lack of context relations among objects. Results for all object categories can be found in the supplementary materials.\n\nCamera Pose Estimation We evaluate the camera pose by computing the mean absolute error of yaw and roll between the model estimation and ground truth.

The SUN RGB-D dataset has 47 scene categories with high-quality 3D room layout, 3D camera pose, and 3D object bounding boxes annotations. It also provides benchmarks for various 3D scene understanding tasks. Here, we only use the RGB images as the input. Figure 3 shows some qualitative results. We discard the rooms with no detected 2D objects or invalid 3D room layout annotation, resulting in a total of 4783 training images and 4220 test images. More results can be found in the supplementary materials.\n\nWe evaluate our model on ﬁve tasks: i) 3D layout estimation, ii) 3D object detection, iii) 3D box estimation iv) 3D camera pose estimation, and v) holistic scene understanding, all with the test images across all scene categories. For each task, we compare our cooperatively trained model with the settings in which we train GGN and LON individually without the proposed parametrization of 3D object bounding box or cooperative losses. In the individual training setting, LON directly estimates the 3D object centers in the 3D world coordinate.\n\n3D Layout Estimation Since SUN RGB-D dataset provides the ground truth of 3D layout with arbitrary numbers of polygon corners, we parametrize each 3D room layout as a 3D bounding box by taking the output of the Manhattan Box baseline from [Song et al., 2015] with eight layout corners, which serves as the ground truth.

We also evaluate the IoU between free space (3D voxels inside the room polygon but outside any object bounding box) of the ground truth and the estimation.

Moreover, we further improve the individually trained results by 8.8% on geometric precision, 5.6% on geometric recall, 6.6% on semantic recall, and 3.7% on free space estimation.

Moreover, our model runs at 2.5 fps (0.4s for 2D detection and 0.02s for 3D estimation) on a single Titan Xp GPU, while other models take signiﬁcantly much more time; e.g., [Izadinia et al., 2017] takes about 5 minutes to estimate one image. Here, we further analyze the effects of different components in the proposed cooperative model, hoping to shed some lights on how parametrization and cooperative training help the model using a set of ablative analysis.",

The existing methods either are ineffective or only tackle the problem partially. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model that simultaneously solves all three tasks in real- time given only a single RGB image. The essence of the proposed method is to improve the prediction by i) parametrizing the targets (e.g., 3D boxes) instead of directly estimating the targets, and ii) cooperative training across different modules in contrast to training these modules individually. Speciﬁcally, we parametrize the 3D object bounding boxes by the predictions from several modules, i.e., 3D camera pose and object attributes. The proposed method provides two major advantages: i) The parametrization helps maintain the consistency between the 2D image and the 3D world, thus largely reducing the prediction variances in 3D coordinates. ii) Constraints can be imposed on the parametrization to train different modules simultaneously. We call these constraints \"cooperative losses\" as they enable the joint training and inference. We employ three cooperative losses for 3D bounding boxes, 2D projections, and physical constraints to estimate a geometrically consistent and physically plausible 3D scene. Experiments on the SUN RGB-D dataset shows that the proposed method signiﬁcantly outperforms prior approaches on 3D object detection, 3D layout estimation, 3D camera pose estimation, and holistic scene understanding.",

In fact, we can directly supervise the learning process with 2D objects annotations using the common sense of the object sizes.\n\n• The physical plausibility loss penalizes the intersection between the reconstructed 3D object boxes and the 3D room layout, which prompts the networks to yield a physically plausible estimation.\n\nFigure 1 shows the proposed framework for cooperative holistic scene understanding. Our method starts with the detection of 2D object bounding boxes from a single RGB image. Two branches of convolutional neural networks are employed to learn the 3D scene from both the image and 2D boxes: i) The global geometry network (GGN) learns the global geometry of the scene, predicting both the 3D room layout and the camera pose. ii) The local object network (LON) learns the object attributes, estimating the object pose, size, distance between the 3D box center and camera center, and the 2D offset from the 2D box center to the projected 3D box center on the image plane. The details are discussed in Section 2. By combining the camera pose from the GGN and object attributes from the LON, we can parametrize 3D bounding boxes, which grants jointly learning of both GGN and LON with 2D and 3D supervisions.\n\nAnother beneﬁt of the proposed parametrization is improving the training stability by reducing the variance of the 3D boxes prediction, due to that i) the estimated 2D offset has relatively low variance, and ii) we adopt a hybrid of classiﬁcation and regression method to estimate the variables of large variances, inspired by [Ren et al., 2015, Mousavian et al., 2017, Qi et al., 2018].\n\nWe evaluate our method on SUN RGB-D Dataset [Song et al., 2015]. The proposed method out- performs previous methods on four tasks, including 3D layout estimation, 3D object detection, 3D camera pose estimation, and holistic scene understanding. Our experiments demonstrate that a coop- erative method performing holistic scene understanding tasks can signiﬁcantly outperform existing methods tackling each task in isolation, further indicating the necessity of joint training.\n\nOur contributions are four-fold. i) We formulate an end-to-end model for 3D holistic scene under- standing tasks. The essence of the proposed model is to cooperatively estimate 3D room layout, 3D camera pose, and 3D object bounding boxes. ii) We propose a novel parametrization of the 3D bounding boxes and integrate physical constraint, enabling the cooperative training of these tasks. iii) We bridge the gap between the 2D image plane and the 3D world by introducing a differentiable objective function between the 2D and 3D bounding boxes. iv) Our method signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time.",

            "text": "2.2 Direct Estimations\n\nAs shown in Figure 2(a), the global geometry network (GGN) takes a single RGB image as the input, and predicts both 3D room layout and 3D camera pose. Such design is driven by the fact that the estimations of both the 3D room layout and 3D camera pose rely on low-level global geometric features. Speciﬁcally, GGN estimates the center CL, size SL, and the heading angle θL of the 3D room layout, as well as the two rotation angles φ and ψ for predicting the camera pose.\n\nMeanwhile, the local object network (LON) takes 2D image patches as the input. For each object, LON estimates object attributes including distance D, size SW, heading angle θW, and the 2D offsets δI between the 2D box center and the projection of the 3D box center.\n\nDirect estimations are supervised by two losses LGGN and LLON. Speciﬁcally, LGGN is deﬁned as\n\nLGGN = Lφ + Lψ + LCL + LSL + LθL, (2)\n\nand LLON is deﬁned as\n\nN\n\nN 1 Lion wo, + £51 + Low + Low), (B) jz\n\nwhere N is the number of objects in the scene. In practice, directly regressing objects’ attributes (e.g., heading angle) may result in a large error. Inspired by [Ren et al., 2015, Mousavian et al., 2017, Qi et al., 2018], we adopt a hybrid method of classiﬁcation and regression to predict the sizes and heading angles. Speciﬁcally, we pre-deﬁne several size templates or equally split the space into a set of angle bins. Our model ﬁrst classiﬁes size and heading angles to those pre-deﬁned categories, and then predicts residual errors within each category. For example, in the case of the rotation angle φ, we deﬁne Lφ = Lφ−cls + Lφ−reg. Softmax is used for classiﬁcation and smooth-L1 (Huber) loss is used for regression.\n\n2.3 Cooperative Estimations\n\nPsychological experiments have shown that human perception of the scene often relies on global information instead of local details, known as the gist of the scene [Oliva, 2005, Oliva and Torralba, 2006]. Furthermore, prior studies have demonstrated that human perceptions on speciﬁc tasks involve the cooperation from multiple visual cues, e.g., on depth perception [Landy et al., 1995, Jacobs, 2002]. These crucial observations motivate the idea that the attributes and properties are naturally\n\n4\n\ncoupled and tightly bounded, thus should be estimated cooperatively, in which individual component would help to boost each other.\n\nUsing the parametrization described in Subsection 2.1, we hope to cooperatively optimize GGN and LON, simultaneously estimating 3D camera pose, 3D room layout, and 3D object bounding boxes, in the sense that the two networks enhance each other and cooperate to make the deﬁnitive estimation during the learning process. Speciﬁcally, we propose three cooperative losses which jointly provide supervisions and fuse 2D/3D information into a physically plausible estimation. Such cooperation improves the estimation accuracy of 3D bounding boxes, maintains the consistency between 2D and 3D, and generates a physically plausible scene. We further elaborate on these three aspects below.\n\n3D Bounding Box Loss As neither GGN or LON is directly optimized for the accuracy of the ﬁnal estimation of the 3D bounding box, learning directly through GGN and LON is evidently not sufﬁcient, thus requiring additional regularization. Ideally, the estimation of the object attributes and camera pose should be cooperatively optimized, as both contribute to the estimation of the 3D bounding box. To achieve this goal, we propose the 3D bounding box loss with respect to its 8 corners",

[2018] proposes a similar regularization in which the parametrization of 3D bounding boxes is different.\n\n2D Projection Loss In addition to the 3D parametrization of the 3D bounding boxes, we further impose an additional consistency as the 2D projection loss, which maintains the coherence between the 2D bounding boxes in the image plane and the 3D bounding boxes in the world coordinate. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the learning objective of the projection from 3D to 2D as\n\nN 1 7 «|J2 Conor = ap Da FOGTRK) —X3 Il, () j=\n\nwhere f(·) denotes a differentiable projection function which projects a 3D bounding box to a 2D j ∈ R2×4 is the 2D object bounding box (either detected or the ground truth). bounding box, and XI∗\n\nPhysical Loss In the physical world, 3D objects and room layout should not intersect with each other. To produce a physically plausible 3D estimation of a scene, we integrate the physical loss that penalizes the physical violations between 3D objects and 3D room layout\n\nN 1 y . . Vy Leny = id > (ReLU(Max(Xj\") — Max(X”)) + ReLU(Min(X\") — Min(X}\"))), © j=l\n\nwhere ReLU is the activate function, Max(·) / Min(·) takes a 3D bounding box as the input and outputs the max/min value along three world axes. By adding the physical constraint loss, the proposed model connects the 3D environments and the 3D objects, resulting in a more natural estimation of both 3D objects and 3D room layout.\n\nTo summarize, the total loss can be written as\n\nLTotal = LGGN + LLON + λCOOP (L3D + LPROJ + LPHY), (7)\n\nwhere λCOOP is the trade-off parameter that balances the cooperative losses and the direct losses.\n\n3 Implementation\n\nBoth the GGN and LON adopt ResNet-34 [He et al., 2016] architecture as the encoder, which encodes a 256x256 RGB image into a 2048-D feature vector. As each of the networks consists of multiple output channels, for each channel with an L-dimensional output, we stack two fully connected layers (2048-1024, 1024-L) on top of the encoder to make the prediction.\n\nWe adopt a two-step training procedure. First, we ﬁne-tune the 2D detector [Dai et al., 2017, Bodla et al., 2017] with 30 most common object categories to generate 2D bounding boxes. The 2D and 3D bounding box are matched to ensure each 2D bounding box has a corresponding 3D bounding box.\n\n5\n\n(top 50%). (Left) Original\n\nResults projected in\n\nFigure 3: Qualitative results (top 50%). (Left) Original RGB images. (Middle) Results projected in 2D. (Right) Results in 3D. Note that the depth input is only used to visualize the 3D results.\n\nSecond, we train two 3D estimation networks. To obtain good initial networks, both GGN and LON are ﬁrst trained individually using the synthetic data (SUNCG dataset [Song et al., 2017]) with photo-realistically rendered images Zhang et al. [2017b]. We then ﬁx six blocks of the encoders of GGN and LON, respectively, and ﬁne-tune the two networks jointly on SUN RGBD dataset [Song et al., 2015].\n\nTo avoid over-ﬁtting, a data augmentation procedure is performed by randomly ﬂipping the images or randomly shifting the 2D bounding boxes with corresponding labels during the cooperative training. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] for optimization with a batch size of 1 and a learning rate of 0.0001. In practice, we train the two networks cooperatively for ten epochs, which takes about 10 minutes for each epoch. We implement the proposed approach in PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2017].",

            "text": "5.2 Related Work\n\nSingle Image Scene Reconstruction Existing 3D scene reconstruction approaches fall into two streams. i) Generative approaches model the reconﬁgurable graph structures in generative probabilistic models [Zhao and Zhu, 2011, 2013, Choi et al., 2013, Lin et al., 2013, Guo and Hoiem, 2013, Zhang et al., 2014, Zou et al., 2017, Huang et al., 2018]. ii) Discriminative approaches [Izadinia et al., 2017, Tulsiani et al., 2018, Song et al., 2017] reconstruct the 3D scene using the representation of 3D bounding boxes or voxels through direct estimations. Generative approaches are better at modeling and inferring scenes with complex context, but they rely on sampling mechanisms and are always computational ineffective. Compared with prior discriminative approaches, our model focus on establishing cooperation among each scene module.\n\nGap between 2D and 3D It is intuitive to constrain the 3D estimation to be consistent with 2D images. Previous research on 3D shape completion and 3D object reconstruction explores this idea by imposing differentiable 2D-3D constraints between the shape and silhouettes [Wu et al., 2016, Rezende et al., 2016, Yan et al., 2016, Tulsiani and Malik, 2015, Wu et al., 2017]. Mousavian et al. [2017] infers the 3D bounding boxes by matching the projected 2D corners in autonomous driving. In the proposed cooperative model, we introduce the parametrization of the 3D bounding box, together with a differentiable loss function to impose the consistency between 2D-3D bounding boxes for indoor scene understanding.\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nUsing a single RGB image as the input, we propose an end-to-end model that recovers a 3D indoor scene in real-time, including the 3D room layout, camera pose, and object bounding boxes. A novel parametrization of 3D bounding boxes and a 2D projection loss are introduced to enforce the consistency between 2D and 3D. We also design differentiable cooperative losses which help to train two major modules cooperatively and efﬁciently. Our method shows signiﬁcant improvements in various benchmarks while achieving high accuracy and efﬁciency.\n\nAcknowledgement: The work reported herein was supported by DARPA XAI grant N66001-17- 2-4029, ONR MURI grant N00014-16-1-2007, ARO grant W911NF-18-1-0296, and an NVIDIA GPU donation grant.
